**1.C ANSWER TEMPLATES OF PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION**

**Q.1 : What is public Administration? Discuss meaning, scope, and significance of public Administration.**

**Similar questions:**

**‚Äú**Nature, scope, and dimensions of both theory and practice of Public Administration have undergone sea changes in past 125 years‚Äù Explain.

**ANSWER TEMPLATE: INTRODUCTION:**

Meaning of public administration can be understood at two levels first is the practice of Public Administration as action arm of the Govt and other is the theory of Public Administration as an academic discipline. As a practice, public administration is government in action. Whatever government does are done through the machinery of large numbers of officials, organisations, rules and regulations, all parts of Public Administration. The official working in public organisations, such as ministries, Govt. department, public enterprises, regulators, etc, may be called pubic administrators. The core of the practice part of public administration is its bureaucratic set up. The multiple levels of officials from the local government to state and Central Government, who are related each other in an informal and hierarchical structure, and who work impersonally and objectively as per the prevailing laws, rules and regulations constitute the bureaucratic set up of the Govt. As a practice Public Administration is as old as human civilisation. Since the time people started living under State, Public Administration emerged to manage the affairs of the state.

As far as the theory of Public Administration is concerned, it means study of how the

affairs of government through its bureaucratic set up is carried out. What are the principles and norms of behaviour followed by the public administrator? what are their roles and responsibilities? what is the relation between public administrator and the politicians in formulation of public policies? etc. forms the subject matter of public administration? It also includes hypothesizing and theory building in the field of public administration. To compare models of public administration in different countries/cultures, finding pattern and through them hypothesizing to build theories or principles which can be applicable to

large numbers of other regions/cultures/contexts also become part of the academic field of public administration.

In a nutshell, we may say that as practice, public administration is management of affairs of government by an organisational structure which act on behalf of people, attempt to solve vague and complex societal problem by taking collective decisions, and endeavour to achieve common Good. The ‚Äòpublic‚Äô in the public administration denotes public spiritedness, public accountability, public participation in governance, and working on behalf of People, public interest , public access, public scrutiny, etc. Hence, public administration is accessible, transparent, and accountable to public at large. As a field of academic study, it means understanding the practice of Public Administration, developing theories and principles of Public Administration, and helping the practitioners of Public Administration (the public administrators) to best fulfil the aspirations of the society/people.

In the next part of the answer I will try to explain in brief the nature, scope, and significance of public administration. I will also try to give a brief account of how both its nature and scope has changed in recent times.

**Definitions of Public Administration:**

Following are some of the most popular definitions:

- ‚ÄúPublic Administration is detailed and systematic application of law. Every

  particular application of law is an act of Administration.‚Äù -- Woodrow Wilson.

- ‚ÄúPublic Administration is the action part of government, the means by which the purpose and goals of government are realized.‚Äù --Carson & Harris
- ‚ÄúPublic Administration is that part of the science of administration which has to do with government, and thus concerns itself primarily with the executive branch, where the work of government is done, though there are obviously administrative works also in connection with the legislature and judicial branches.‚Äù Luther Gulick
  - ‚ÄúBy Public Administration it means, in common usage, the activity of the executive branches of the national, state and local government.‚Äù -- Herbert Simone
- Public Administration is "the art and science of management applied to the affairs of the State" - D. Waldo.

From these definitions it is clear that Public Administration denote the executive organ of the State, that is the Government. It is through Public Administration that Govt carries its day to day affaires and also formulate and implement public policies to solve societal problems.

**Nature of Public Administration:**

- **Politics- administration Dichotomy**
  - Since beginning a line was drawn between politics and Public Administration as far as public policy are concerned. Public policy making was considered in the domain of Politics. The Public Administration was merely supposed to implement the policies made through the political process in apolitical, value-neutral, objective, efficient, economic manner. Thus, Politics- administration Dichotomy was created.
- **Universal Principles of Administration- scientific management**
  - In the academic field of Public Administration, there have been many attempts to formulate scientific and universal principles of administration applicable across different socio-cultural settings.
  - For example, scientific management theory by Taylor, Administrative principles by Fayol, Bureaucratic theory by Weber, etc
- **Uneasy relation with political science and management**
  - As an academic field of study, Public Administration had uneasy relations with both political science and management.
  - Political science has been like step father to Public Administration. It was thought to a sub-field of political science but faced competition with it.
    - General Management has been like upmarket cousin to Public Administration.
    - In its course of, Public Administration has gone closer to management and political science in different period of its evolution as self-standing academic field.
- **Its nature in recent times:**
  - Self-standing field of theory and practice, distinct from both political science and general management.
  - **Theory**: Diverse, Multi-disciplinary, multi-theoretical;
  - **Practice**: networked/joined, decentralized, collaborative, contextual response to governance, problem-solving attitude
  - Politics- administration Dichotomy gave way to Politics- administration Continuum.
  - Attempt to solve complex and poorly defined social problems by collective decision making in particular socio-cultural contexts has been the hallmark of Public Administration in recent times

**Scope of Public Administration:**

- **Traditional**
  - Implementation of constitution, law, public policy ‚Äì operative part of executive arm of the state.
  - Maintaining Law & order, defense, communication, diplomacy/foreign relations. ‚Ä¢ Managing day-to-day (routines) affairs of government.
  - PODSCORB: **P**lanning, **O**rganizing, **D**irecting, **S**taffing, **C**oordinating, **R**eporting and **B**udgeting. (*Gullick and Urwick, 1937*).
  - Domain‚Äì State/govt., Bureaucracy; focus as academic discipline: Developing

    universal and scientific ‚Äúprinciples of administration‚Äù.

- **Modern/contemporary**
  - Help formulate, implement, and evaluate public policy; make and enforce rules/regulations.
  - Formulate plan, programs, schemes and implement them.
    - Delivery of public services, public welfare and providing public goods.
  - **Development administration**: Working to ensure faster economic growth, development of human resource, and development of other resources, infrastructure. Also ensuring social equity- minimizing income/wealth distribution.
  - **Regulations** on behalf of Government.
  - **Managing public organizations**- PSUs, Regulators, Statutory/autonomous organizations, Municipalities/municipal corporations, NGOs, not for profit organizations, etc.
    - Part of all 3 organs of state‚Äì executive, legislature, and Judiciary. Now lots of administration are done in both legislative and Judicial arms of the state.
  - Collective/shared decision making and endeavour to solve complex, poorly defined social problems to make life better for all.

**Significance of Public Administration:**

- **Tangible/visible/operative part of state/govt. ‚Äì govt in action**
  - Public Administration is the interface between state and citizen.
- **Help formulate public policy**
  - Help the politicians in policy making.
  - Play very important role in law making.
  - Entire Rules/regulations, called subordinate legislation, are made exclusively by public administrators
- **Implement public policy** to make it reality and instrument of solving societal problems.
- **Maintain peace & order**, provide continuity, and stability in governance. Unlike fast changing political administration, it is the permanent administration of the state/Govt.
  - As an academic field help develop principles of efficient and effective public administration, train and produce better skilled public administrator**.**

**Conclusion:**

Public administration is the action arm of the Government. It is the mainstay of the executive organ of the state. As a field of practice, public administration is as old as human civilization. However, as a field of academic study, it has a very brief existence of about

130 years. It is started with an article on Public Administration by Woodrow Wilson in 1887 in USA. Since then, it has been in a very interesting journey of public administration as an independent domain of knowledge wherein it has developed uneasy relationship with both its originator, that is political science, and its companion, the general management. Today it is a self-standing academic field.

The practice of public administration has also seen significant changes in its nature and scope in in recent times. In the era of a globalised world dominated by neoliberal free market economy, the public administration has become networked, more objective, development oriented, pro change, more efficient, participative and accountable.

In the main part of the answer, I have tried to explain in brief the nature and scope of public administration both as a practice and field of academic study. Those explanations also indicate the changes in its nature and scope in recent times. However, one thing in it has not changed, which is its significance. It has remained as significant as it was in earlier times. Rather in the globalization era its significance has increased. From its earlier focus on maintaining law & order, and collecting revenue, it has become multi-faceted, multi

dimensional, networked, dynamic, more skilled, equipped, efficient, effective, participative, and oriented towards solving complex societal problems. Hence, it is as significant and relevant as ever.

**Q.2: Define Public Administration. Briefly discuss its evolution as an academic discipline in modern times.**

**Similar Question :** Discuss changing perspective on public administration with special reference to Minnowbrook conferences I, II, and III.

*(Hint: for the first part of the question, refer to Q.1 above. Then add the following: for the question on Minnowbrook conferences, refer the changing perspective on Public Administration in three Minnowbrook conferences at page 14 )*

**Introduction:**

In its existence of about 130 years as distinct field of academic study, public administration has gone through many phases of evolution. Its evolution started with an article by Woodrow Wilson in 1887 wherein he delineated(defined) both the need of an apolitical( separate from politics) administration based on scientific principles and the boundary of it which was to carry out in a non-partisan and efficient manner the policies made through the political processes. Thus, Woodrow Wilson created the Policy-Administration dichotomy. Policy making was considered in the domain of politics. Public Administration was not supposed to enter into the policy making domain. Since then both the theory and practice of public administration has evolved through multiple phases in its current form.

We can identify at least six to seven phases of the evolution of public administration. The initial phase was from 1887- 1926 in which the discourse of politics-administration dichotomy as initiated by Woodrow Wilson dominated in the academic circle. In 1926 LD White‚Äôs book, *the introduction to study of public administration*, which was the first textbook entirely devoted to the field, made a great contribution to establish public administration as an independent subject domain of human knowledge. The next phase from 1927 to 1937 saw the development of universal scientific principles of Administration. Within the academic community of Public Administration there was a belief that the ‚Äòscience‚Äô of Administration can be discovered objectively and can be universally applied to different kinds of organisations in different regions and cultural setting. This phase ended in in 1938 with the demise of the dichotomy between politics and administration. During this phase there was evolution of general belief that administrative decisions are heavily laden with political values and policy preferences and hence cannot be separated from politics. The next phase was from 1950 to 1970 in which public administration was searching for its independent academic status. It went sometime closer to political science and then to management. The next phase starting from 1970 had seen public administration growing as a distinct self-standing academic field. It got separated from both its originator, that is the political science and its companion, management. Instead of politics -administration dichotomy, this phase saw Political-Administrative Continuum.

1970s was also the period when New Public Administration (NPA) emerged as an outcome of the first Minnowbrook Conference in 1968. This phase continued for next 15 to 20 years after which a new phase represented by New Public Management (NPM) came. This was an attempt by the public administration to adjust to the neoliberal ideologies which dominated the governance model in the Western world. NPM was also the outcome of the second Minnowbrook conference in 1988. Thereafter, in the twenty-first century the concept of New Public Service (NPS) emerged. New concepts and discourses became part of the evolution of public administration which is trying to adjust to the new globalised world. Concepts such as networked or joined up government, collaborative or participative governance, development administration, Good Governance, etc. became part of the subject matter of Public Administration. 3rd Minnowbrook conference in 2008 was an attempt to search new path for the public administration in the globalised world to keep it relevant and useful to the changing world.

Thus, we can see that in past about 130 years of its existence as independent field of knowledge, public administration has gone through multiple phases of evolution. One thing is clear from the above description that it tried to adjust to the changing socio-economic and political environment to remain relevant and useful for the society. As the environment changed, so changed the theory and practice of public administration. Such changes can be identified as different phases of its evolution, brief of which was stated above.

In the next part of the answer I will try to further elaborate upon the points made above.

**EVOLUTION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AS AN DISTINCT ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE:**

- **Initial phase: 1887-1926: Politics-Administration dichotomy**
  - Started with Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs article ‚Äì‚Äô*the study of administration* (1887)‚Äô in which he expressed need for administration based on systematic and disciplined body of knowledge which can carry out the policies made by the political processes

    and deliver public services in non-partisan and efficient manner. Thus, he separated policy making from policy implementation. Public administration was not to enter into the policy making domain which was the preserve of elected political officials. Hence, he created the **politics-administration dichotomy**

    - Frank J. Goodnow carry forwarded the movement for evolving the discipline of public administration as distinct subject domain in USA. In his book *Politics and Administration*, he also drew a functional distinction between politics and administration.
    - 1926: L.D. White‚Äôs book ‚Äú *introduction to study of public administration*‚Äù was the 1st textbook entirely devoted to the field of Public Administration**.** This gave new impetus and momentum to evolution of Public Administration as a distinct academic disciple.
- **1927-1937: Scientific Principles of Administration**
  - This phase saw attempts to develop scientific and universal principles of administration which can be applied to different organisations, regions, and cultural settings.
  - *‚ÄòScientific Management Theory‚Äô* of Taylor; ‚Äò*Ideal type of bureaucracy*‚Äô by Weber, ‚Äò*Principles of Public Administration*‚Äô by Willoughby, Administrative principles by Fayol, Gullick & Urwick, etc. were part of the attempt to make Public Administration a scientific and objective domain of knowledge.
  - This phase also blurred the distinction between private and public organization. Both were thought to be governed by same administrative principles*.*
- **1938-1950: Challenges to politics-administration dichotomy and Scientific Principles of Administration:**
  - Demise of the Dichotomy with growing belief among the academic community that administrative decisions are heavily laden with normative political values and policy preferences. Hence, administration cannot be fully separated from politics.
  - Simon‚Äôs ‚Äò*Administrative behavior*‚Äô in 1947 ; Decision making theory- ‚Äò*bounded rationality‚Äô and ‚Äòsatisficing‚Äô* punctured universal principles of administration. He denounced them as mere proverbs.
  - Thus, belief in universal applicability of scientific management and administrative principles ( of Taylor, weber, Fayol, Willoughby, etc) declined. It was accepted that the context matters.
  - Growing acceptance of Human relation theory of Elton Mayo, which was developed in 1920s, also diminished the value of scientific principles of administration.
  - **1950-1970: Public administration as sub-field of Political Science and Management**
    - During this period behavioural revolution was affecting all social science discipline, including political science. Focus was on value free objective, empirical facts, and scientifically testable hypothesis.
      - This phase witnessed Public Administration searching for its separate identity as academic discipline, different from both political science and management.
      - Uneasy adoption by Political science as Public Administration as its sub-field.
    - Searching for commonality with management. In many universities, Public Administration was taught in the department of management.
      - It was believed that same management principles are applicable to both private and public organizations. ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô in Public Administration was getting diluted.
- **1970- present: Public administration as distinct, self-standing academic field :** ‚Ä¢ Separation from both Political Science and Management.
  - Distinct paradigm of subject domain of Public Administration was developed. It was distinct from both Political Science and Management.
    - It developed as multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical academic discipline.
  - Politics-administration dichotomy gave way to Political-Administrative Continuum. It was accepted that Public Administration cannot be totally value neutral. It cannot be limited to merely implementation of the policies. Public Administration is supposed to realize the values people cherish. It is supposed to help political leaders in policy formulation in an objective, non-partisan manner.
- **3 Minnowbrook conferences and further evolution of Public** Administration:
  - 1st Minnowbrook conferences in 1968 saw the emergence of New Public Administration (NPA). It was acceptance of Dwight waldo‚Äôs prescription that Public Administration must maintain its ‚ÄòPublic Spiritedness‚Äô by creating public value. Emphasis on developing value-neutral science of administration was discarded. Focus shifted on social equity, public welfare, and people centric administration.
  - 2nd Minnowbrook conferences in 1988 changed the discourse. It was the beginning of the neo-liberal era of Raegan( in USA) and Thatcher( UK). To adjust itself to the changing socio-economic environment, Public Administration came in its new avatar as New Public Management(NPM). Now, the focus shifted to efficiency, economy, accountability, outcome, and management. Public organisations were supposed to be better managed on the market principles and management practices followed in private organisations, especially the MNCs.
  - The 3rd Minnowbrook conferences in 2008 was an attempt to make Public Administration relevant and useful in the globalization era. The concepts of new public services (NPS), networked & joined up government, collaborative & participative Governance, and Good governance, etc now dominate the discourse of academic discipline of Public Administration

**Conclusion**:

In its about 130 years of existence as a separate domain of academic discipline, public administration has seen multiple phases of evolution. Each phase denotes its attempt to adapt(adjust) to its changing socio-economic and political environment. With the change of the environment its discourse, academic focus, research methodology, and overall orientation changed. This, from politics-administration dichotomy, initiated by Woodrow Wilson, politics- administration continuum was accepted.

New public administration (NPA) in 1970s was a response to interventionist and welfare state model of 1970s. When the environment changed into neo-liberal governance model in USA and UK under the Thatcher-Reagan Era, it also changed to New Public Management (NPM). With the current era of globalisation engulfing the entire world, public administration has also attempted to remain relevant and useful by coming up with new concepts and governance models such as New Public Service (NPS), development administration, collaborative governance, networked and joined up government, and finally the Good Governance which combined many of these concepts.

Through its entire period of existence and process of evolution, public administration has kept its importance and relevance intact. In the globalisation era when it is understood that States are retreating and giving way to market forces in management of economy, public administration has remained as important and relevant as ever. Even the market forces look towards public administration for guidance and solution of complex societal problems. Current phase of pandemic and important role played by Public Administration proves this point.

**Q.3: Differentiate between public and private administration. How in recent times the relationship between them has changed?**

**Introduction:**

Private administration is different from Public Administration in many ways. The word ‚Äòpublic‚Äô before administration make it distinct from private administration. The ‚Äòpublic‚Äô here denotes denotes public spiritedness, public accountability, public participation in governance, working on behalf of people, public interest, public access, public scrutiny, etc. All these features are either absent or in much diluted form in private administration. The essential difference between these two kinds of administration is publicness or public orientation of the public administration. Their aims are also fundamentally different. Public Administration aims to create public value by solving complex social problems through its acts and decisions, on the contrary, aim of private administration is to increase profit and shareholder‚Äôs wealth. Public administration is governance on behalf of the people under the full gaze of public view, scrutiny and accountability. Actions and decisions of Private administration are hidden from public view and public scrutiny.

However, of late, particularly in the globalisation era, deep differences between public and private organisation has diluted to a great extent. Both have come much closer in recent times to solve complex societal problems. This process started in 1990s with New Public Management (NPM) which was re-orientation or re-invention of public administration in accordance with neoliberal ideologies and management principles of private organisations, especially MNCs. Under the NPM paradigm. the public organisations also aim for efficiency, economy, customer satisfaction, performance measurement, outcomes, and accountability. This has manifested in the practice of outsourcing of govt jobs to private sector ( now from manpower supply to vehicle provision, ICT infra maintenance, etc., private sector is actually running most of the services in Govt organisations), disinvestment and privatisation, lateral entries of private sector managers into public administration ( for example, Mr. Nandan Nilakeni of Infosys led the UIDAI and its Aadhar project), increasing role of top leaders of private sector in economic policy formulation, consultancy of private firms for Govt projects, adoption of similar ICT tools and technologies, including social media platforms by both public and private administration, competition between public and private organisation in public service delivery, and collaborative public private projects known as public private partnership (PPP) projects. In fact, PPP is the best example of coming together of private and public administration.

Thus, in today's globalised world, both public and private sectors have joined hands to

solve the complex societal problems. Today instead of a clear-cut dichotomy between public and private administration we can see more of a public- private continuum in public administration.

In the next section of the Answer, first I will try to list out some of the key differences between private and Public Administration. Thereafter, I will discuss how distinction between them have diluted in the globalized era of Public Administration.

**Public Vs Private Administration:**

Following are some the major differences between private and Public Administration:

|**Basis of comparison**|**Public administration**|**Private administration**|

**Discussion and conclusion:**

Since beginning there has been much debate about the difference between public and private administration. The differences listed above were considered as natural and universal. Though, since beginning there were many thinkers who viewed such differences as artificially created. The meaning of administration as collective and cooperative social endeavour to solve common problems by managing resources is common to both public and private administration. Also, the administrative principles developed as classic theories of administration and management did not differentiate between public and private organisation. Taylor's principle of scientific management, weber's theory of bureaucracy, PODSCORB by Gullick and Urwick, Administrative principles by Fayol, Human relation theory of Mayo, etc. were thought to be applicable equally to both public and private administration.

But there were many who contended (opposed) by claiming that nature, features, scope, and orientation of public administration are different from those of private administration. The essential difference between them was the ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô prefixed before the ‚ÄòAdministration‚Äô in Public Administration. Aim of Public Administration is to create public value whereas the aim of private administration is to create profit and shareholder‚Äôs wealth. Public Administration act on behalf of the public who have got the right to participate, scrutinize, and hold public administration accountable. Scope of public administration is

much broader, entire society and all aspects of socio-economic system are affected by the acts, omissions and decisions of Public Administration. All these features are lacking in private administration.

However, such clear-cut distinction has now been eliminated to a great extent in the globalised era of collaborative public administration. Now, both private and public organisations have joined hands to solve complex societal problems. This is manifested in the practice of contracting out govt jobs to private sector, lateral entries of private sector managers into public administration, increasing role of top leaders of private sector in economic policy formulation, consultancy of private firms for Govt projects, and collaborative public private projects known as public private partnership (PPP) projects.

Hence, the relation between private and Public Administration has taken a full circle. Starting with very close association in its early phase of scientific principles of management era, public administration drifted apart in concept and practices from private administration in its later phases of evolution. But in the globalised era, they have now again come together to solve vague, poorly defined, complex social problems. In the currently ongoing pandemic, the private organisations joined hands with public organisations to tackle the biggest challenge to humanity. Private administration today has become an important actor in the collaborative Governance model of Public Administration.

**Q.4: ‚ÄôPublic Administration has undergone significant changes in the era of globalization‚Äô. Comments**

**Similar Question**: Examine the changing nature and scope of Public Administration. How Globalization affected its nature & scope?

**Answer Template: Introduction**:

Globalisation is faster and closer integration and interconnectedness of economy, markets, production and distribution systems, nations, regions, and peoples of the world. It has swept across the globe in past two decades. No aspect of our socio economic and political life has been left untouched by the wave of Globalisation. Globalisation has brought out Paradigm shift in the nature, role and functions of the Westphalian State system. Many feel that globalisation has diluted the sovereignty of the state. Now many of the activities particularly economic, financial, and activities carried on the world wide web( such as e commerce, digital entertainment, social media), are beyond the control of the domestic government/state.

Public administration as the action arm of executive branch of the state, has been fundamentally affected by the globalisation phenomena in last two decades. New Public Management (NPM) movement within public administration was a precursor to the globalised public administration. NPM was the response of public administration to adjust to the new liberal ideologies which dominated the socio-economic and political discourse in the majority of the nations in the post-cold war era. Economic liberalisation, privatisation, treating citizen as customer, focus on efficiency, economy, performance measurement, outcomes, transparency and accountability etc became new features of public administration under the NPM paradigm.

In the 21st century under the intensive phase of globalisation, public administration saw further changes in form of New Public Service (NPS), moving from government to governance model, networked and joined up government, collaborative governance, and ‚ÄòGood Governance‚Äô. In the globalised era the public administration changed its role from ‚ÄòRowing‚Äô to ‚ÄòSteering‚Äô. It meant that instead of directly doing many activities, such as production/manufacturing and delivery of public services, it allowed private sectors to provide public goods and services under its guidance and watch. Thus, public administration became enabler rather than the provider of public services.

Rolling back of the state in the globalisation era compelled public administration to adopt collaborative governance model. The ICT revolution which made globalisation possible also impacted public administration substantially. First, street level Bureaucracy (in which the Govt official decides application of law/rule from case to case basis) changed to machine level bureaucracy(in which the govt official sits in front of the computer, which decides the case electronically as per the software programme) after computerisation of Govt departments. Then, under the networked and joined up Government, it changed into a ‚Äòsystem level bureaucracy‚Äô. One example of which is online provision of scholarships to students in which multiple government agencies join through computer network to

completely make the system online.

One of the prominent impacts of globalisation on public administration was blurring the distinction between public and private administration. Instead of the public-private dichotomy it has become more like public-private continuum. Public private partnership (PPP) projects are the best example of the public private continuum.

In the next part of the answer I will try to explain in brief the points made above:

**Following are some of the important changes brought out in the nature, role, functions of Public Administration in the globalization era:**

1\.**Steering Not Rowing:**

New role of the ‚Äòenabler‚Äô or ‚Äòfacilitator‚Äô by privatizing the substantial part of production/manufacturing and service delivery functions.

Globalisation brought privatisation and liberalisation along with it. Under the structural adjustment program in guidance of IMF, developing nations were compelled to privatise. Privatisation was done in many ways. In addition to outright privatisation of public enterprises, privatization of public service delivery, namely, contracting out, encouraging private service provisioning, allowing private sector‚Äôs entry into many sectors which were reserved to public sector, introducing quasi-markets in public service delivery, mobilizing voluntary sectors, etc were also done. Net result of privatisation was that the Public Administration instead of doing many activities itself allowed them to be carried out by the private sector under govt regulation. For example, take electricity distribution. Private DISCOMs were allowed to provide electricity services under the electricity regulator. Similarly, almost each sector witnessed entry of private sector and coming up of sectoral regulators to keep watch on private sector.

2. **From Government to Governance model:**

Instead of Govt as executive arm of the state being the sole actor in Governance, and Public Administration being its action arm, governance now denotes collaborative and participative management of affairs of the society/state. Now private sector, NGOs, civil society, citizens, and international organisations, etc joined the state in governance. Collaborative governance is one significant change in Public Administration due to globalisation.

3. **Networked and Joined up Government:**

ICT, which brought globalisation also made government joined up and networked. Previously each Govt department worked in Silos (separately). For one service, citizen might have to visit multiple departments. All this changed with networked govt. This helped transformation of bureaucracy from a ‚Äòstreet level bureaucracy‚Äô to ‚Äòsystem level bureaucracy. ICT also brought e-Governance model in Public Administration. Today, even Govt departments use social media such as twitter for connecting to people.

4. **Public Administration not bound by the state boundary:**

In the age of globalisation, the Public Administration of states came in direct contact with

international organisation, MNCs, International NGOs, non-state regulators, etc. For example the Indian Public Administration now has to deal with Amnesty international (an INGO), Amazon, Twitter & Facebook (MNCs), WHO (international organisation),etc. Thus, Public Administration has to look beyond the domestic boundary and work in collaboration with many organisations which were based outside the national boarder. This has thrown whole set of new challenges to the functioning of Public Administration

5. **Changing relation between citizen and Public Administration:**

Globalisation has empowered citizen vis-√†-vis Public Administration. Wave of Internet, social media, e-commerce, m-commerce, privatisation of public service delivery, concept of open & transparent govt, collaborative governance, Good Governance model, system level bureaucracy, e-governance, etc has empowered the citizen. Now citizen don‚Äôt treat public administrator as ‚ÄòSarkar‚Äô or ‚Äòguardian like figure‚Äô. They demand efficient and effective services from Public Administration. Globalisation has paid a big role in making citizen a ‚Äòcustomer‚Äô for the Public Administration.

6. **Blurring the distinction between public and private administration:**

In the globalisation era, deep differences between public and private organisation has diluted to a great extent. Both have come much closer in recent times to solve complex societal problems. This process started in 1990s with New Public Management (NPM) which was re-orientation or re-invention of public administration in accordance with neoliberal ideologies and management principles of private organisations, especially MNCs. Under the NPM paradigm. the public organisations also aimed for efficiency, economy, customer satisfaction, performance measurement, outcomes, and accountability. This has manifested in the practice of outsourcing of govt jobs to private sector, disinvestment and privatisation, lateral entries of private sector managers into public administration, increasing role of top leaders of private sector in economic policy formulation, consultancy of private firms for Govt projects, competition between public and private sector in public service delivery, adoption of similar ICT tools and technologies, including social media platforms by both public and private administration, and collaborative public private projects known as public private partnership (PPP) projects. In fact, PPP is the best example of coming together of private and public administration.

Thus, in today's globalised world, both public and private sectors have joined hands to solve the complex societal problems. Today instead of a clear-cut dichotomy between public and private administration we can see more of a public- private continuum in public administration.

This is perhaps the greatest impact on the Public Administration. Its ‚Äòpublicness‚Äô has diluted to some extent with the wave of globalisation.

**Conclusion**:

In the globalisation era when States are retreating, rolling back, and giving way to market forces in managing the affairs of the nation, public administration has changed itself to adapt to new globalized environment. In fact, Public Administration itself has globalised. It has gone beyond the domestic boundary to work together with non-state and international agencies. It has acquired ‚Äòsteering‚Äô role with regulation of sectors opened up to private sector. It networked itself to became joined up govt. It has transformed itself from ‚Äòstreet level bureaucracy‚Äô to ‚Äòsystem level bureaucracy. It adopted collaborative governance model, allowing citizen, civil society, NGOs, and IGOs, etc to participate in governance. Globalisation blurred the private-public dichotomy. Now, it is more like private-public continuum. It led to more open and transparent governance model. The governance standard became the ‚ÄòGood Governance‚Äô model.

Thus, Public Administration changed significantly in the globalisation era. But despite such sweeping changes it remained as important and relevant as ever. Even the market forces and global organisations look towards the domestic public administration for guidance and solution of complex societal problems. Current phase of pandemic and important role played by Public Administration in collaboration with multiple agencies, domestic as well as global, proves this point.

**THEME 2: CLASSICAL THEORIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT THEORY BY TAYLOR**

**2.A: CBCS SYLLABUS:**

- Scientific Management Theory by F.W.Taylor
- Main principles, features, Pros & Cons

**2.B: KEY POINTS:**

- Scientific management theory by Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856 ‚Äì 1915) is the first and foremost among the classical theories of administration.
- Other classical theories of administration: Fayol's fourteen principles of organization, ‚ÄòPOSDCORB‚Äô by Gulick & Urwick, Bureaucratic theory by Weber, and Principles of Public Administration by Willoughby.
- Classical theories of administration were claimed to be scientific and universal, that is, they were applicable to organisations of any type- private or public, in any where in world.
- Taylor was an American mechanical engineer who worked lifelong to understand and increase the efficiency in the industrial sector. The theory was based on his 1911 book ‚Äò*the principles of scientific management‚Äô*.
- Essence of the theory was that understanding the science of work, and by that finding the best way to do a job, efficiency of production can be increased by increasing the labour productivity.
- Scientific management principle was a path breaking theory in the early period of public administration as an independent academic discipline. It gave a great respectability to the subject. By this theory the public administration claimed to have developed scientific and universal theory of managing factories, workplace and industrial organisations. The theory claimed universal applicability in diverse organisations around the globe in different regions and cultural setting.
- **4 core principles of Scientific Management:**
  - **Science, not rule of Thumb**:
    - Developing true science of work: one best way to do any job
    - **Scientific Selection, training and development of workers:**
      - Best fit between the job and the worker
  - **Bringing together science of work and scientifically selected and trained worker**
    - **Division of labour and responsibility between management and workers:**
      - Harmony, not discord : harmony at workplace, happy workers
- The main aim of scientific management theory was to increase profit of capitalist mode of production by increasing efficiency and labour productivity.
- **Basic logic/rational behind the scientific management**: Since, the profit is nothing but surplus value of labour; more the labour productivity, more will be the profit. If the profit is more the products can be sold at lower price by passing some part of the profit to the consumers. Also, the workers can be paid more. Despite passing of some part of the increased profit to workers and consumers, the capitalist class would have more profit, both by increased labour productivity and by selling more products at lower price. Thus, it was a win-win situation for all the stakeholders.
- In practice, Henry Ford adopted it in best possible way extracting all the above benefits. Success of Ford gave wide acceptability and popularity to the theory.
- The theory was widely applied and adopted in USA, Russia, Japan, and developing countries like India
- **Pluses or Pros of the theory**: Substantially increased productivity, more responsible and engaged management, increased profit and lower prices, and giving respectability to the subjects

**Minuses or Cons:** De-skill, de-humanize, and automate labour; Undermine humanistic aspects at workplace ; Vague claim of being scientific; not much benefit to workers, and increased workload and anxiety among both the managers and workers. Herbert Simon disintegrated the theory by denouncing it as mere proverbs. There was nothing scientific in this theory, claimed Simon.

- Despite such criticism and minuses, scientific management principle of Taylor is still relevant and being used worldwide in different forms. The essence and the core of the theory that by breaking job into parts, careful study of each part, time and motion involved in them, careful studies of the design of tools and implements, the science of work can be found and replicated and by that labour productivity and production efficiency can be increased is still very much valid and relevant.

**2.C: ANSWER TEMPLATES OF PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION**

**Q.1: Critically examine the main principles of Scientific Management Theory.**

**Similar Question:** Explain the Principles of Scientific Management Theory, bringing out its pros and cons.

**Answer: Introduction**:

- Scientific management principle was given by Frederick Taylor, an American mechanical engineer who worked life long to understand and increase the efficiency in the industrial sector. It was the first and foremost among the classical theories of administration. The theory was based on his 1911 book ‚Äò*the principles of scientific management‚Äô*. Essence of the theory was that understanding the science of work, and by that finding the best way to do a job, efficiency of production can be increased by increasing the labour productivity. Scientific management principle was a path breaking theory in the early period of public administration as an independent academic discipline. It gave a great respectability to the subject. By this theory the public administration claimed to have developed scientific and universal theory of managing factories, workplace and industrial organisations. The theory claimed universal applicability in diverse organisations around the globe in different regions and cultural setting.

Core principles of the scientific management theory were: **first**, developing science of work by gathering knowledge of all aspects of work by breaking it into parts, recording, analysing and publishing them as an formula to be adopted by workers; **second**, scientific selection, training &development of workers; **third**, bringing together the science of work and scientifically selected and trained workers; **fourth**, division of labour and sharing of responsibilities between the managers and the workers. Taylor believed that if for each job both the management and workers are equally involved there would be harmony between them and there will be less industrial dispute.

The main aim of scientific management theory was to increase profit of capitalist mode of production by increasing efficiency and labour productivity. Since, the profit is nothing but surplus value of labour; more the labour productivity, more will be the profit. If the profit is more the products can be sold at lower price by passing some part of the profit to the consumers. Also, the workers can be paid more. Despite passing of some part of the increased profit to workers and consumers, the capitalist class would have more profit than before, both by increased labour productivity and by selling more products at lower price.

Thus, it was a win-win situation for all the stakeholders. In practice Henry Ford adopted it in best possible way extracting all the above benefits. Success of Ford gave wide acceptability and popularity to the theory.

But such successes were not universal. At many industrial units both the managers and workers complained of excess load, fatigue, and alienation(disaffection) from the job. It was mainly because scientific management increased the workload of both the manager and workers. It also dehumanized the labour by treating them like pre-programmed machine and robot. The labour became mere cog in the wheel. He lost whatever autonomy he had in the capitalist mode of production.

Despite some of its minuses as stated above, the scientific management principle became the theoretical pillar of classical capitalist mode of production. This theory became most popular in 1920s which was the period of monopolist capitalism - the golden period of capitalism.

In the next part of the answer I will try to explain in brief the core principles of scientific management theory, its features and critical analysis by giving its pluses and minuses.

**4 Principles of Scientific Management:**

- **Science, not Rule of Thumb: Developing true ‚ÄòScience of Work‚Äô**
  - Gathering traditional knowledge of work from workers. Recording, organizing, and making it law/rule/formula of doing a work in one best possible way.
    - Applying these law/rule/formulae to everyday work of all workers.
  - Breaking job into its constituent parts. Time and motion study to each part of job, and worker‚Äôs movement.
  - Scientific study of tools/implements to design them for optimum output. ‚Ä¢

**Scientific Selection, training and development of workers:**

- Deliberate study of aptitude, skills, nature, and performance of each worker to select best worker for a specific job.
  - Systematic and regular training on new methods, tools, conditions.
  - Developing each worker to his greatest efficiency and prosperity.
- **Bringing together science of work and scientifically selected and trained worker:**
  - Actual implementation of new law/rule/formula at workplace by putting greater responsibilities on management side.
    - ‚ÄòMental Revolution‚Äô both on part of management and workers.
- **Division of labour and responsibility between management and workers: Harmony, not discord**
  - Mutual dependence and intimate cooperation between managers and workers.
  - Managers had to do something on the job before the workers act on them. It meant for each job, managers were equally engaged with the workers.

**Features of Scientific Management:**

- **Scientific analysis of time, motion, workflow, tools, implements, etc. to increase labour productivity and production efficiency**:
  - Standardization of work, working conditions (light, temperature, rest time, etc), material, tools and implements.
  - Breaking a job into many small parts, and finding best method (least time and motion) to do that job.
- **Man as machine**: Aim to make workers as efficient as pre-programmed machine- mere cogs in a wheel.
- **Separation of planning and execution/operation parts of Job.**
  - Before execution, minute planning of the job.
- **Greater responsibility on managers**
  - Scientifically organize knowledge, plan for everything, involve fully in whatever workers do.
- ‚Äò**Differential rate‚Äô or ‚ÄòPiece-rate‚Äô wage system**: Workers paid higher or lower based on amount of job done.
- **Functional organizational structure**
  - **Functional foremanship**: each labour reports to 8 functional expert supervisors/foreman.
  - **4 planning foreman**-route clerk, instruction card clerk, time and cost clerk, discipline clerk
    - **4 execution foreman**- Gang boos, speed boss, repair boss, and Inspector.

**Critical analysis of the scientific management principles:**

Following are some the pluses and minuses(critiques) of the theory:

|**Pluses/ pros**|**Minuses/cons**|
| - | - |
|Increased labour productivity and efficiency Greater output, surplus, and profit|De-skilled, de-humanized, and automated labour, made them like machine- mere cog in the wheel.|



|More wages to workers, more profits to owners, less price to consumers|Undermine human and psychological aspects at the workplace.|
| :- | :- |
|Less conflict between management and workers- less strike, more production efficiency|Vague claim of being scientific. Taylor didn‚Äôt make public his data, experiments, and statistics.|
|Division of labour and sharing of responsibilities between managers and workers- harmony and industrial peace.|Workers didn‚Äôt benefit from Increase in surplus. Capitalist class cornered most of the increased profit.|
|Gave respectability to the subject- widely followed/adopted. First and foremost of the classical theories.|Increased both worker‚Äôs and manager‚Äôs workload and anxiety.|

**Discussion and Conclusion:**

From the above description of scientific management principles given by Frederick Taylor it is clear that it was one of the bedrock( core, foundational) theories under the classical theories of public administration during early phase of evolution of Public Administration as independent academic discipline. The theory was given at the time when the academic discipline of public administration was trying to search its place, acceptability, and respect as a distinct body of human knowledge. This theory helped it gaining that standing and respectability. The theory claimed to be scientific, based on facts, data, statistics, and analysis. It also claimed to have been tested in different organisational conditions. In actual practice it became successful in increasing the labour productivity and profit. Henry Ford‚Äôs success by adopting the principles of scientific management gave it wide acceptability. It became the scientific and rational face of capitalist mode of production.

Thus, scientific management theory of Taylor became a path breaking theoretical enterprise in the academic discipline of public administration. The essence of the theory was to increase the efficiency of production and profit by increasing labour productivity by understanding and formulating the science of work. By scientific selection, training and development of worker and by bringing together the science of work and scientifically selected and trained workers, labour productivity and hence production efficiency could be increased many times, the theory claimed. By division of labour and responsibility between management and worker, harmony and industrial peace could be better maintained. Ultimate aim of the theory was to help increase the profit. Naturally, the profit would be more if efficiency and labour productivity increases. More profit meant more wages to workers, less price of the products, and more gains to the capitalist class. Thus, the theory was a win-win situation for all the stakeholders.

However, the theory was criticised to have de-skilled, de-humanized and automate the labour to make it like machine- mere cog in the wheel. Another charge was that it undermined human relation aspect at workplace. Elton Mayo proved this criticism through his human relation theory. Another criticism was that workers did not benefit from increased profit, which was mostly cornered by the capitalist class. It also increased the workload of both workers and managers and hence both were dissatisfied with the implementation of scientific management at workplace. Later on, Herbert Simon disintegrated the theory by denouncing it as mere proverbs. There was nothing scientific in this theory, claimed Simon.

Despite such criticism and minuses, scientific management principle of Taylor is still relevant and being used worldwide in different forms. The essence and the core of the theory that by breaking job into parts, careful study of each part, time and motion involved in them, careful studies of the design of tools and implements, the science of work can be found and replicated and by that labour productivity and production efficiency can be increased is still very much valid and relevant.

- Ideal-Type Bureaucracy (Bureaucratic Theory) by Max Weber.
- Main principles( propositions), features, Pros & Cons.

**3.B: KEY POINTS**

- Ideal type of Bureaucracy by Maximilian Karl Emil **Weber** (1864 ‚Äì1920) is a conceptual construct and measuring yardstick (standard) using which historical evolution of complex organization, which he called Bureaucracy, can be explained.
- Bureaucracy denotes organizational structure of large and complex organization in modern period.
  - Bureaucracy also indicate evolution of organizations based on traditional and charismatic authority in pre-modern times to those based on rational-legal authority in modern times.
- Weber had the view that Bureaucracy is the most suitable organizational structure for large and complex organizations in modern period. It brings efficiency, economy, rationality, and optimum results/output.
- Essential features of Bureaucracy are:1. Based on rational- legal authority, 2. Division of labour, expertise and specialization 3. Hierarchical structure, 4. Primacy to rules/regulation, 5. Impersonal relation, 5.Merit-based selection, and 6.Career orientation.
- Bureaucratic theory of Weber is linked to economic aspects of capitalism, religious/spiritual aspects of ‚ÄòProtestant Ethics‚Äô, normative values (Rights, Liberty, Equality) of liberal democracy. Thus, in a nutshell, the Bureaucratic Theory of Weber was the organisational dimension of Liberalism- liberal democracy and capitalism- promoted by the ideologies of Christian or Protestant ethics of the Western world.
- Because of the above point, many charge the theory suffering from both ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism. They view the bureaucratic theory as part of the package of western ideology and worldview.
- Bureaucracy is not limited to Public Administration. Bureaucratic structure may be found in large & complex organisation in any sector-academics( universities), big factories, in business, such as multinational corporations, International organisations, such as United Nation, even in Non-governmental organisation, such as Amnesty International, and of course in public administration.
- However, Bureaucracy got intimately associated with Public Administration. They were used as synonyms.
- Of late Bureaucracy acquired negative meanings( or minuses) associated with Public Administration - red tape, nepotism, corruption- but continued to be indispensable for managing govt, MNCs, Factories, Schools, hospitals, or any large & complex organization.

3. **C: ANSWER TEMPLATES TO PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS**

**Q.1 : Briefly examine Max Weber‚Äôs Ideal type Bureaucracy.**

**Similar Question:** Critically Discuss Max Weber‚Äôs Bureaucratic Theory. **Introduction:**

Ideal type of bureaucracy was part of the bureaucratic theory propounded by one of the greatest sociologists of modern period, Max Weber. The theory was contained in his book ‚Äò*the ideal type of Bureaucracy - economy and Society‚Äô* which was published in 1921 a year after his death. The theory of bureaucracy of Max Weber was closely linked to his idea of evolution of complex society in modern period; Bureaucracy denotes evolution of large and complex organisation in modern society, which moved increasingly towards rationality, secularization and meritocracy. Weber placed bureaucracy at the end of history of evolution of organisation in human society.

To him, the organisations in ancient and mediaeval period were based on traditional and charismatic authority/leadership in which kinship, relationship, customary and traditional entitlement, etc were the basis of selection/appointment. Loyalty was to the leader as a person not to his position. With the advent of capitalism, industrial society and liberal democratic nation-states, the organisation of the government, factories, universities, and in many other fields started moving towards rational-legal authority, selections based on merit, loyalty to post/position not to the person, primacy to rules and regulation and not to traditional knowledge or rule of thumbs, rational/logical not subjective attitude, etc. Weber termed such organisation as bureaucratic organisation. in his view Bureaucracy represents the natural evolution of most efficient structure of a large and complex organisation in modern period.

Essential features of weber's Ideal type of bureaucracy is: **first**, division of labour, high degree of specialisation and expertise; **second**, hierarchical, command and control, impersonal relationship between super-ordinate (boss) and subordinate; **third**, primacy of objective rules and regulations; **fifth**, rational-legal authority; **sixth**, meritocracy; **seventh**, career orientation. In sum, hierarchy, impersonality, specialisation, rule/regulations, and meritocracy were the defining features of bureaucracy.

It may be noted that ideal type of bureaucracy was not the organisational structure found in real world situation. Rather, it was an idea, conceptual construct, or a kind of measuring rod to compare organisational structure in time and space. It may also be noted that the bureaucratic theory of Weber is linked to economic aspects of capitalism, religious/spiritual aspects of ‚ÄòProtestant ethics‚Äô, normative values (Rights, Liberty, Equality) of liberal democracy. Thus, in a nutshell, the bureaucratic theory of Weber was the organisational dimension of Liberalism -liberal democracy and capitalism - promoted by the ideologies of Christian or Protestant ethics of the Western world. Therefore, high degree of eurocentrism and ethnocentrism are evident in this theory. Another criticism of the theory is that it is mechanistic, and based on closed model of organisation, which means that the organisation is static, status quoist, and cut off from its external environment.

Despite such criticism, bureaucratic theory of Weber along with the scientific theory of

Taylor became the twin pillars of the classical theories and principles of Administration in in its early phase of evolution as a self-standing academic discipline. The bureaucratic theory was so robust and timeless that it is still the most visible face of public administration anywhere in world. In fact, the term bureaucracy is used synonymously with public administration.

However, it may be noted that Bureaucracy is a specific form of organisational structure which any large and complex organisation shall attain in modern times. It may also be noted that bureaucracy is not only limited to public administration; complex organisations in academics such as universities, in industrial sector, such as big factories, in business, such as multinational corporations, International organisations, such as United Nation, even in Non-governmental organisation, such as Amnesty International, and of course in public administration bureaucratic organisational structure can be found. But the word bureaucracy acquired a kind of negative connotation( meanings) and was linked with the negative aspects of public administration such as Red-tape (purposely delaying decisions), nepotism( favourtism), insensitiveness (towards people‚Äôs problems), and corruption.

In the next section of the answer I will try to explain in brief the core features of the ideal type of bureaucracy, as given by Weber, its other characteristics, and Pros & Cons.

**Ideal type of Bureaucracy: Essential Features:**

Following are the defining features of the ideal type of bureaucracy:

- **Division of labour:**
  - This entails **expertise** and high degree of **specialization.**
    - Thus, in bureaucratic structure workers are encouraged to do same type of job for a long period of time. Hence, they become expert and specialist in their job.
  - Division of labour removes overlapping of responsibilities. Each worker is supposed to do different job, for which he is expert.
  - Both expertise and division of labour increases efficiency, and reduces cost of producing good & services.
- ‚Äò**Rational-Legal Authority‚Äô**
  - One gets a post or position due to his knowledge, expertise, achievements. Hence, each position draws its authority and legitimacy on rational ground.
  - Also, each position has some legal authority, sanctioned by laws, rules & regulations.
  - This is very different from non-bureaucratic organisation, in which the basis of authority may be traditions, conventions, or personal charisma of the post or position holder.
- **Hierarchical** authority structure
  - Top down structure
  - Command and control relationship between super-ordinate(boss) and subordinate. ‚Ä¢

Unity of command: only one superior/boss to any subordinate official. ‚Ä¢ **Impersonal** relationship among bureaucrats and bureaucracy and citizen/client

- Personal relationship does not come into the way of selection, reward and

  punishment.

  - The loyalty and obligation are to the post/position not to the person.
- Primacy of **rules** and **regulations**
  - Decisions are taken based on rules & regulations and NOT based on personal relationship or equations.
  - Primacy of rules & regulations curb the tendency for nepotism and corruption. It also increases transparency and certainty of decisions.
- **Meritocracy:**
  - Recruitment and promotions based on **merit**: skill, ability, knowledge, expertise, achievements.
  - This minimize nepotism, corruption, and favouritism.
- Development of a **career service**: career bureaucrat, protection of tenure ‚Ä¢ Bureaucrats have long tenure. This help them become experts in their domain. ‚Ä¢ Gives stability and increases efficiency.

**Other important characteristics of the ideal type of bureaucracy:**

- Not reality, but a **conceptual construct** to explain historical evolution of authority and organization.
- May be used as ‚Äòmeasuring rod‚Äô or benchmarking standard to compare organizational structure in time and space.
- Also, used to trace the evolution of organizations in different regions/cultures over the period of time.
- **Supported Politics-Administration Dichotomy**
  - Impersonal, rule and merit based, rational, expert permanent administration ‚Ä¢ Highly volatile, interest and power-based politics.
  - Administration is supposed to be aloof from the political values, and partisan politics.
- Bureaucracy as organization based on ‚ÄòRational-Legal‚Äô Authority
  - As opposed to ‚ÄòTraditional‚Äô and ‚ÄòCharismatic‚Äô Authority in organizations of ancient and medieval periods.
- Manifest economic values of capitalism, normative values of liberalism, political values of Democracy, and religious/spiritual ethics of Protestant Christianity.
- Thus, bureaucracy is organizational structure in conformity with the western ideologies and values. Hence, it is part of the western ideological package of Capitalism, Liberalism, representative democracy, and Protestant ethics.
- Not limited to Public Administration. Bureaucratic structure may be found in large and complex organizations in any field- academics(universities), industry( large factories, MNCs), NGOs, even political parties( BJP, Congress).
- However, bureaucracy has become synonymous to Public Administration. It has also

acquired negative connotations and got associated with Red-tape, Nepotism, and Corruption in public organization.

**Critical analysis of the the ideal type of bureaucracy:**

- Following are some the pluses and minuses(critiques) of the theory:

  |**Pluses/ pros**|**Minuses/cons**|
  | - | - |
  |First and foremost theory of organization. Along with the scientific management theory, twin pillars of the classical administrative theories.|Mechanistic, de-humanistic and closed model of organisation|

**Discussion & Conclusion:**

From the above discussion it is obvious that Max Weber‚Äôs theory of Bureaucracy and his conceptual construct of Ideal type of Bureaucracy should be understood along with his sociological and historical construct of the development of modern society led by the western ideologies of liberal democracy, capitalism, and Protestant ethics. He traced the evolution of complex organisation throughout the historical time and reached to the conclusion that organisations have evolved from charismatic and traditional based authority to rational- legal authority. This gave rise to most efficient and effective organisational structure which he called bureaucracy. Essential features of bureaucracy are rational legal authority, specialisation, hierarchy, impersonality, rules/regulation, meritocracy, and career orientation.

Bureaucracy as a form of organisational structure based on rational legal authority and having some essential features as stated above, is not limited to public administration. However, the word bureaucracy was intimately linked to public administration. Both were used as synonyms. Of late, the word bureaucracy acquired negative connotation. It denoted the negative aspects of public administration such as Red-tape, nepotism and corruption. Another notable point is that the ideal type of bureaucracy was not a reality but and a conceptual construct or a kind of benchmarking standard for comparing the organisational structure anywhere in world in space and time.

Despite its wider acceptability, applicability, robustness, popularity, timelessness and practical usefulness, it has been criticized for being mechanistic, following close model of organisation, curb individualism and innovation, being rigid, static and inflexible, and giving rise to bureaucracy as a self-seeking interest group, and finally suffering from ethnocentrism and eurocentrism. In fact, many scholars, especially of 3rd world, claimed that bureaucracy essentially was part of western ideological package of capitalism, liberalism, and Protestant ethics. Bureaucracy was superimposed on third world developing nations by the colonial powers, disregarding varied cultural settings in the colonial societies. Such superimposition of bureaucratic structure on 3rd world countries resulted into many contradictions, such as formalism, overlapping and heterogeneity. Some of

which were studied by Fred Riggs as part of his ecological study of public administration. Despite such criticism, Bureaucratic theory of Weber remained relevant, useful, and widely implemented theory in Public Administration.

**4. C: ANSWER TEMPLATES TO PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS**

**Q.1: Discuss Elton Mayo's Human Relations theory with special reference to Hawthorne experiments.**

**Similar Questions:**

1\. Critically examine Elton Mayo's Human Relations theory.

**Answer Template: Introduction**:

Human relation theory was propounded (given) in late 1920s and 1930s by Elton Mayo, an Australian born psychologist, industrial researcher, and organizational theorist, who taught at Harvard, USA. In the era when scientific management principles of Taylor was ruling the theoretical discourse of administration and management, Mayo gave an entirely new approach to understand organisation and factors which affected labour productivity. It was social approach to understand organisation, its subsystem, and role of human relations in individuals and groups. It was a kind of supplementary theory to scientific management approach in which the workers were treated as ‚Äòeconomic man‚Äô who can be induced(encouraged) by economic incentives to perform better. On the contrary, the human relation approach considered organisation as a social system and viewed the workers as a ‚Äòsocial man‚Äô whose motivations and performance are affected by social and human relations aspects at the work place. The theory highlighted the impact of non-economic social factors such as worker‚Äôs attitude towards work, membership to group norms, group dynamics, sense of participation and belongingness, praise and recognition, relationship with fellow workers and supervisor etc on the motivation and productivity of labour at workplace.

Thus, it was altogether different way to visualise the organisation. In scientific management approach the organisation was viewed as collection of rational individuals who are self-interested and hence can be induced to perform better by economic means (differential wages and better working condition, training, better tools, etc). On the contrary, in the human relation approach organisation was visualised as a social and cooperative human arrangement in which the social norms and inter-personal relationships

at workplace matters. Instead of treating worker as mere cog in the wheel as in the scientific management approach, human relation theory treated worker as unique individual embedded in his social settings both at the workplace and at his home. The organisation was extension of the social environment of the worker.

The human relation theory of Elton Mayo was part of a theoretical movement in administration and management called human relation movement. Many others thinkers/theorists such as *Murray McGregor, Abraham Maslow, Chester Irving Barnard , Rensis Likert, etc.* led the human relation movement as an alternate approach to understand organisation and labour productivity.

Elton Mayo linked his human relation theory of Administration to the larger social problem of the Industrial society. He visualised the disintegration of social norm, social routines, and crisis of value system of the evolving industrial society. To him, the social crisis of the industrial society reflected at the workplace, which was the extension of the larger social environment of the industrial workers.

Four Hawthorne Experiments at the Hawthorne plant of Western electric company, a subsidiary of AT&T Telephone Company near Chicago, in USA, between 1924-32 were the base for Elton Mayo‚Äôs hypothesis about effect of social and human relation aspects on the motivation and performance of the worker in an industrial organisation. The **first and second experiment** were the great illumination experiment between 1924-27 followed by relay assembly test room experiment for next 6 years on the same group of 6 female workers. In the experiments the working condition, such as lighting, heating, sitting arrangement, rest periods, etc were varied on the test and control groups to test their effect on the labour productivity. The **third experiment** was human attitude and sentiment through interviews of the workers. More than 21000 workers were asked to express their views on the management policies, working conditions, their own views about the organisational goal/vision, etc. **Fourth experiment** was the bank wiring experiment in which the team of 14 male workers were tested for group norms and group dynamics without their knowledge.

All these experiments collected huge amount of data and statistics which were analysed by Mayo and his team. It is interesting to note that most of Hawthorne experiments gave confusing data and statistics. For example, in the great illumination and relay assembly test room experiments, the performance of both the test and control group continued to increase despite deteriorating working conditions. But Mayo used the almost failed experiments and confusing data sets to highlight the social and human relation aspects and their impact on workers‚Äô motivation and productivity.

On the basis of his analysis of Hawthorne experiments, Elton Mayo claimed that the workers do not behave as rational ‚Äòeconomic man‚Äô at workplace, rather they behave as ‚Äòsocial man‚Äô who are affected by social and human relation conditions at the workplace. Individual worker is embedded into his socio-cultural settings and behave as per the appropriate social norms( and not only to maximise his self-interest) at the workplace. His relationship with his colleagues, subordinates, and superiors, as well as his larger social networks and social relationship outside the organisation affect his motivation, aspiration, and performance at the workplace.

Thus, organisation to the worker is not only a place where he does his job and gets paid, rather it is a major part of his social environment in which the worker finds his identity, his social bearings, social norms and values, and his own standing and position in the overall social settings. Thus, to the worker, the organisation is the most important part of

his social environment in which he finds himself embedded ( rooted).

Therefore, Elton Mayo claimed that merely by improvement in working conditions and economic incentives, the labour productivity cannot be increased. The management must treat workers from the social and human relation perspective. They should try to satisfy the

workers emotionally, psychologically, and socially. In Mayo‚Äôs view, the informal organisation, the group norms, and leadership etc greatly affect the labour productivity.

In the next part of the answer I will try to further elaborate the points made above. I will also try to critically evaluate the theory by highlighting its pros and cons.

**The core principles of Human Relation Approach to Administration and Management:**

- Viewing organization as social system consisting of many sub-systems- project teams, worker groups, formal and informal organizations.
- Instead of behaving as ‚ÄòEconomic Man‚Äô, workers, most of the time, behaves as ‚ÄòSocial Man‚Äô at their workplace. Instead of simply trying to maximize their self-interest, they try to behave as per the norms of appropriate social behaviour.
- Hence, purely economic incentives- wage rate, bonus, good working conditions, training, better tools. etc- may not be the only motivating factors.
- Social factors- Worker‚Äôs attitude towards work, Membership to groups norms, sense of participation and belongingness, praise and recognition, relationship with fellow worker and supervisors, etc. may affect worker‚Äôs motivation and productivity.
- Instead of treating worker as mere cog in the machine, the management should treat worker as unique individual embedded in his social settings both at the work place and at his home.

**The Hawthorne Experiments:**

Following are the brief of 4 Hawthorne Experiments carried out by Mayo and his team during 1924-32 at the Hawthorne plant of Western Electrical Company near Chicago, USA:

Four set of experiments were carried out Between 1924-32; they were led by Mayo, and supported by Roethlisberger and Dickson.

- **Great Illumination Experiment (1924‚Äì27) and Relay Assembly Test Room (1927-33)**
  - Two groups of 6 women workers assembling telephone relays were formed. One was control group, whose conditions were not changed, and second was the experiment group, whose working conditions were changed. Both groups were observed for their productivity.
  - Physical working environment- Lighting, temperature, humidity, working hours, rest periods, etc were changed for the experiment group. Performance of both the groups were compared and analyzed.
  - Surprisingly, performance of both the groups went up despite lowering of the working conditions of the experiment group. Hence, no correlation could be found between working condition/environment and labour productivity.
- **Human Attitude and Sentiments experiment (1928-31):**
  - Interview/personal interaction with more than 21000 workers who were asked to express their views on management policies, working conditions, etc.
  - Workers ventilated their problems, many of them not related to their workplace. Most of these views were negative in nature related to the management and the working conditions. Some of the problems were in their families and neighbourhood.
  - Helped better understanding of worker‚Äôs personal history and his social situation at work; more engaged worker.
  - Productivity went up after the interview experiments**.**
  - Mayo concluded that the increase in productivity was because of the interview program which acted as a **Ventilation Therapy** for the workers and at the same time, the workers developed a sense of belongingness, the ‚Äòwe‚Äô feeling. The feeling that someone is listening their views raised their self-esteem.
- **The Bank Wiring Experiment (1931-32)**
  - Teams of 14 male workers doing soldiering, wiring, and fixing terminals were studied without them being aware of it. It may be noted that earlier three experiments were known to the workers under observation.
  - Workers were getting bonus/incentive according to group performance. Despite this, groups performed below target. Members producing more or less and those who revealed group‚Äôs information to management were socially outcasted.
  - The study found out that the supervisors have set a target but the workers were not working as per the targets set by the supervisor. Rather, they produced less than the target fixed by the supervisor. Very interestingly, the productivity of all the workers was similar. The group itself has set a target which is below the supervisor‚Äôs target.
  - The group, in order to ensure compliance of the workers towards the group target, introduced several social strategies such as social ostracization or social ridiculing, name-calling etc
  - One who produced more than the targets was called as *Ratebuster* and one who produced less than the designated target was called as *Chiseller*. Also, the one who disclosed secrets to the management was called as *Squealer*. They all were ridiculed by the group.
  - From the experiment, Mayo concluded that there was an informal organization present in every formal organization. The performance in the group is affected by group norms which is part of the informal organization.

**Critical analysis of the Mayo‚Äôs Human Relation Theory:**

Following are some the pluses and minuses(critiques) of the theory:



|**Pluses/ pros**|**Minuses/cons**|
| - | - |
|Revealed worker‚Äôs attitude, social behavior in group/team, and human relation dynamics on labour productivity|Sweeping conclusion based on imperfect and somewhat failed Hawthornean experiments, which was full of pitfalls.|
|Discouraged treatment of workers as mere cog in the wheel, like machine ; highlighted social and human side of the organization.|Excess focus on individual‚Äôs social settings, inter-personal relation, and hence, undermined economic, structural, and ecological aspects at workplace.|
|Helped look beyond economic factors as sole motivating factor at work places.|Paternalistic attitude of management. Mangers were expected to guide workers in their social and inter-personal relations. This might undermine individual autonomy of the workers.|
|Highlighted importance of informal groups, participative management, and employee engagement.|Utopic idea of conflict free workplace and fully satisfied labour, which is neither possible nor very healthy. Some amount of conflict between workers and management may be good for workers.|

**Discussion and Conclusion:**

Elton Mayo propounded the human relation theory in response to the scientific management approach of Taylor in which the organisation was considered as assemblage of rational workers who behaved as ‚Äòeconomic man‚Äô. Till then it was believed that by getting the job done in best possible way ( the science of work), improving working condition, and economic incentives, labour productivity can be increased. Social and human relation angle were neglected by the scientific management principles. Elton Mayo attempted to understand the organisation as a social system and workers as a ‚Äòsocial man‚Äô. Worker was not only an employee of the organisation but represented socially embedded individual. Organisation was a part his social environment.

Mayo linked social problems at the organisation of the industrial age to the overall normlessness and value crisis in the social system of the Industrial society. Because of the break from thousands of years of socio cultural and economic system, after the rise of capitalism and industrial revolution, the individuals coming to industrial towns found loneliness, isolated, lost, and having identity crisis due to break in social routines of the past, normlessness, and clash of values. All these reflected in his behaviour, motivation, and performance at the workplace. Elton Mayo tried to understand the social and human relation aspect at workplace and how they are related to overall social setting from which the workers belonged to.

**Human relation approach was an improvement over the scientific management theory**. It actually supplemented and filled the gaps left over by the scientific management principle. It is interesting to note that the Hawthornean experiments were done to validate the principles of scientific management. But Mayo gave it an altogether new turn, used them to validate his own hypothesis of the social crisis of Industrial society and came out with human relation theory of organisation. He did not actually denounce the scientific management principles; he only added a new dimension to it to. Through his theory, he asserted that labour productivity cannot be increased only by applying economic means as recommended by scientific management principles. Thus, it supplemented scientific management principal by highlighting dynamics of social pattern and human relation at the workplace. It helped manager becoming more effective leader by engaging with workers socially, develop better interpersonal relationship with subordinates, superiors, and colleagues.

Despite such useful propositions and many positive aspects, the human relation theory of Elton Mayo was also criticized on many grounds. The first and the foremost criticism was its sweeping conclusion based on imperfect and somewhat faulty Hawthornean experiments. Many criticized Hawthorne experiment for being unscientific. The team of researchers were not trained in research methodologies. Many also pointed out that since the workers were aware that they are being observed, they behaved in a particular manner which made the conclusion less authentic. Also, the experiment considered limited aspects of human behaviour and that too only in one organisation.

United Auto works branded Hawthorne researchers as caw sociologist who had limited Outlook. The researchers simply tried to understand groups or impact of group norms/dynamics on individual and vice-versa; the multifarious social, psychological aspects such as leadership, communication, decision-making, authority, and power were

not considered. The researchers also did not consider any complex aspect of the organisation. They simply focused on the informal aspects of the organisation. Loren Baritz and others criticized Howthrone researches as being anti-union and pro-management.

Despite such criticism, the human relation theory of Elton Mayo was a leap forward from the scientific management approach to administration. It supplemented the scientific management approach and filled the gap left by it. It brought the focus to the social and human relation aspect in the organisational setting. It linked organisation to the larger social environment in which the workers are embedded(rooted). It also gave an altogether new dimensions to understanding the dynamics of group behaviour, social norms, teams, and informal organisations, etc working as a social sub system within the organisation. It started human relation movement in management and administration. It gave a new outlook and tool to the managers and administrators to deal with the workers and get best output from them.

**Q.2: Analyze how Human relation theory of organization is an improvement over scientific management theory.**

**Similar Question:** Human relation theory is an advancement upon scientific management theory; Discuss

*(Hint: In the answer to Q.1 above, this question was also discussed in detail. You may refer that. Here only specific points comparing both the theories are given.)*

**How Human Relation Theory an improvement over scientific management theory?**

- **Core principles of Scientific management approach:**
  - by understanding science of work and finding best way to perform a task, selecting best worker for the job, training the worker to perform the task in best way, providing best working conditions, and economic incentives labour productivity and profits can be increased.
- **Core principles of Human Relation Theory:**
  - Organization is a social cooperative human arrangement to achieve common goal.
  - Hence, social and human relation aspects at the workplace must be understood and taken care of by the management.
  - social pattern, group dynamics, team building, informal organization, and inter relationship among workers and between workers and supervisors, etc. affect worker‚Äôs motivation and hence labour productivity.
    - Hence, only by economic means labour productivity cannot be increased.
- Thus, human relation theory filled the gap in scientific management principles by revealing non-economic, social and human factors affecting labour productivity.
- Therefore, it supplemented (enhanced, added) scientific management by highlighting dynamics of social patterns and human relations in an organization.
- Scientific management limited its attention only to the workplace, shop floor, or the factory. It didn‚Äôt look beyond that. It also neglected the human and social aspects at the workplace.
- It is interesting to note that the Hawthornean experiments were done to validate the principles of scientific management. But Mayo gave it an altogether new turn, used them to validate his own hypothesis of the social crisis of Industrial society and came out with human relation theory of organisation.
- He did not actually denounce the scientific management principles; he only added a new dimension to it to. Through his theory he asserted that labour productivity can be

increased even without applying economic means as recommended by scientific management principles.

- Thus, it supplemented scientific management principal by highlighting dynamics of social pattern and human relation at the workplace. It helped manager becoming more effective leader by engaging with workers socially, develop better interpersonal relationship with subordinates, superiors, and colleagues.
- Human relation theory increased the scope of organization and its management. Organization was viewed as part of the larger social environment of the workers, extension of his/her family and neighbourhood.
- The theory, thus, looked beyond the organization, to understand the social environment of workers, and how that affected worker‚Äôs motivation, aspiration, and attitude towards his job.
- In Scientific management approach the organisation was viewed as collection of rational individuals who are self-interested and hence can be induced to perform better by economic means (differential wages and better working condition, training, better tools, etc).
- On the contrary, in the human relation approach organisation was visualised as a social and cooperative human arrangement in which the social norms and inter-personal relationships at workplace matters. Instead of treating ‚Äòman as machine‚Äô- mere cog in the wheel as in the scientific management approach, human relation theory treated worker as unique individual embedded in his social settings both at the workplace and at his home.
- Scientific management approach treated the workers as ‚Äòeconomic man‚Äô who can be induced (tempted) by economic incentives to perform better. On the contrary, the human relation approach considered organisation as a social system and viewed the workers as a ‚Äòsocial man‚Äô whose motivations and performance are affected by social and human relations aspects at the work place.
- The theory highlighted the impact of non-economic social factors such as worker‚Äôs attitude towards work, membership to group norms, group dynamics, sense of participation and belongingness, praise and recognition, relationship with fellow workers and supervisor etc on the motivation and productivity of labour at workplace.
  - Thus, human relation approach was altogether different way to visualise the organisation.
- For public organization, human relation becomes even more important in comparison to scientific management principles, which had limited perspectives on public administration.
- Public Administration is required to develop good relation with the people. The ‚Äòpublicness‚Äô in the Public Administration also denote this human relation aspect. Many a times, even if a govt official carefully listen to the problems of the people, they feel satisfied.
- Relation between the public officer and citizen, and between the public officer and political leadership and his colleagues and seniors determine the effectiveness of the public organization.
- Hence, the human relation theory added valuable knowledge to the domain of Public Administration, which scientific management principles lacked.
- **Thus, in many ways Human Relation Theory was an improvement over scientific**

**management theory.**

**THEME 5 : NEO-CLASSICAL ADMINISTRATIVE          THEORIES RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING THEORY**

**5.A : CBCS SYLLABUS:**

- Rational Decision-Making Theory by Herbert Simon
- Main principles and features of the theory
- Critical Analysis: its pluses and Minuses.

**5. B: KEY POINTS**

- Herbert Simon, one of the most influential public administration scholars, gave organizational theory based upon decision making analysis at various levels of the organization.
- He propounded Rational choice theory of decision making which was contained in his seminal creation ‚Äò*Administrative Behaviour‚Äô,* which was published in 1947.
- As per the Rational Decision making theory, the rational decision making consisted of 3 phases- Intelligence, Design, and Choice
  - **Intelligence**: scanning environment to identify problems needing solution. Determining the end/goal to be achieved by the decision.
  - **Design**: generating(finding), analysing, and evaluating alternatives(means) to solve the identified problem.
  - **Choice**: choosing the best alternative or mean to solve the problem. Attaching the means to the end/goal or solution to the problem
- In the organizational setting, complete rationality is an ideal situation. In real life ‚ÄòAdministrative man‚Äô has limited or bounded rationality and hence for him ‚Äògood enough‚Äô decision is satisfying and sufficient; thus he is ‚ÄòSatisficing‚Äô rather than ‚ÄòMaximizing‚Äô.
- Limitation of Information, time, cognitive and organizational constraints, etc. limits or bound the rationality of the decision maker.
- Simon viewed organization as hierarchically organized, well-coordinated decision centers in internal and external equilibrium, that is, organization adapted to its external environment. For him, actions are nothing but decision outcomes.
- The theory started a new approach, called decisional approach to study organization. It brought the paradigm shift in the academic discipline of Public Administration.
- Its **Pluses**
  - Path breaking decision making theory of rational choice, innovative concepts of ‚ÄòBounded Rationality‚Äô and ‚Äòsatisficing‚Äô, decisional approach to organisational study.
- **Its Minuses:**
  - Value-fact separation, value-neutral science of administration, incrementalism, status quoist, ignoring environmental factors, and not able

    to provide alternate explanatory theory

**5. C: ANSWER TEMPLATES TO PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS**

**Q.1: Critically examine Herbert Simon‚Äôs theory of rational decision making.**

**Similar Question:**

1. Discuss Herbert Simon‚Äôs theory of rational decision making.
1. Write an essay on Herbert Simon's theory of Rational Decision-Making.

**Introduction**:

Rational theory of decision making was propounded by Herbert Simon, through his book *Administrative Behaviour,* which was published in 1947. Herbert Simon has been one of the greatest thinkers in the domain of Public Administration in modern time. His concept of rational decision making has been the path breaking theory in both administration and management. He gave altogether new concepts of ***Bounded Rationality*** and **Satisficing**. His theory of rational decision making started a new approach to study and analyse organisation as hierarchical structured centres of decision making. Thus, Herbert Simon is credited, through his theory of rational decision making, to have started a decisional approach to study organisational behaviour.

In a nutshell, the rational decision making as given by Simon, consisted of three steps; the first is the **intelligence stage** in which the environment (both internal & external) is scanned to sense and identify problems requiring solution. It is the goal/end setting stage. In the second stage, the **design stage**, the means, or alternatives to solve the identified problem are generated, analysed, and evaluated. This is the most elaborate step in which all the alternatives are evaluated for its cost benefits. Finally, in the **choice phase**, the best alternative, as analysed and evaluated in the design phase, is selected, validated and adopted. The chosen alternative becomes the decision.

It should be noted that rational decision making is an ideal way of decision making by a rational decision maker in ideal situation. But in reality, in the organisational setting, the administrators/managers have bounded (limited) rationality. Hence, they become satisfied by taking a ‚Äògood enough decision‚Äô and do not go for ‚Äòthe best decision‚Äô. Thus, the ‚Äòadministrative man‚Äô **Satisfices**‚Äô (**satis**faction + suf**fice**) rather than maximizes. Thus, rational decision-making is like **Gold Standard** of decision making, which may be used as a yardstick to evaluate the decision making in real organisational situations.

The three steps of the rational decision-making theory are based on the logic of connecting best means to achieve the end or goal. Actually, in the decision-making process, a hierarchical chain of means and ends is made to achieve the overall end or goal of the organisation.

The theory also highlights the value-fact dichotomy in decision making. In the        intelligence step, choosing the problem is based on value judgement whereas the second and third step

should be based on factual judgement. The theory give more stress on scientific, fact based, analytical decisions. The theory also distinguishes between programmed and non programmed decisions. Most of the decisions at the lower and operative levels are routine or programmed decisions, whereas at the higher levels in the organisational hierarchy decisions are non-programmed, that is they are new having no past precedent.

The ultimate aim of the rational choice in organisational decision-making is to have the efficiency, maintaining stability, order, internal and external equilibrium so as to ensure survival and growth of the Organisation.

In the next part of the answer I will try to further explain the rational decision-making process as given by Simon; thereafter, I will try to critically analyse this theory by listing out some pros and cons and finally I will conclude with some observations and importance of the theory.

**3 steps of Rational Decision Making:**

**1st Step: Intelligence- Problem identification:**

- Scanning the environment, both internal & external, sense making, finding problems which require solutions.
- Problems: conditions needing solutions
- Problems are like goal, end. Solution is like means to meet that goal/end.
  - In choosing the goal/end, value judgment on part of the administrator comes into picture. Organizational values, norms, and culture also affect determining the problem/goal/end.
- Whether any condition can be considered as problem is matter of value preference of the organization as well as the decision-maker. For example, in some organization, complaints of bribes may or may not be considered as problem needing solution. Another example: high employee turnover (many employee leaving organization) may or may not be taken as problem. It depends on the values, norms, and overall vision/goal of the organization as well as the value judgement of the decision-maker.

**2nd Step: Design -Finding means(alternatives) to solve the identified problem:**

- Searching, finding means to meet the goal or solve the problem ( the solution to the problem).
- Generating, identifying alternatives.
- Analyzing and evaluating each alternatives- cost/benefit analysis.
- Means-end chain: many alternatives may themselves have Problem- sub problems- which may require 3 phases of Intelligence, Design, Choice. Thus, a chain of means and end may be generated to achieve the organizational goal.
  - For example: Problem: high employee turnover; one of the alternatives: economic incentives, which may have a sub-problem- how to generate additional resources, and so on.
  - Solution or decision at lower level becomes means for higher level decision. Thus, a chain of means-end is required to solve organizational problem.
  - In this phase Factual Judgement dominates, that is, the analysis and evaluation of alternatives should be based on facts, statistics, scientific verifications. Value judgment or rule of thumb, hunch, etc should not be used.

**3rd Step: Choice: Attaching the means (alternatives) to the end( problem):** ‚Ä¢ Choosing the

best (least cost and maximum benefit) alternative as solution to the problem. ‚Ä¢ The chosen alternative is the decision.

- Adopting the choice- that is, making the decision; declaring the decision to all concerned. ‚Ä¢ Validating the choice- consultation & feedback.

**Features of Rational Decision Making:**

- **Means-Ends logic:**
  - Rational choice: Selecting best means/alternatives to reach agreed-upon end/goal.
    - Hierarchical chain of means-ends to achieve overall end/goal of organization. End/goal/solution at lower level becomes means for higher level decisions.
      - For example: to reduce employees taking leaves during festive season, a shop floor manager took the decision to give special incentives to those who work on festive season. For higher administration this decision becomes one of the alternatives to solve the problem of high absenteeism during the festive season.
- **Value fact dichotomy in decision making:**
  - Selection of problem/end/goal are based on value judgment, whereas selections of means/alternatives on factual judgment.
  - Decisions- choosing alternatives- should always be based upon factual judgment. ‚Ä¢

Thus, the theory creates value-fact dichotomy, and give more importance to facts. ‚Ä¢ **Programmed vs non-programmed decisions**

- Programmed: repetitive & routine, goals are clear/known, decision procedure established, taken at lower and operative levels. Such decisions are much more in numbers.
- Non-programmed: new/novel, unstructured, vague & complex problems, taken at higher level. Very few numbers of such decisions are taken.
- **Aim of rational choice**: Efficiency, economy, and better outcome; maintaining internal stability/order and external equilibrium- environmental adaptation for survival and growth of the organization.

**Concept of Bounded Rationality and Satisficing:**

- Rational decision making is an ideal situation, in practice decision making is an exercise in ‚Äòbounded rationality‚Äô. The decision makers are satisfied by choosing good enough decisions, rather than searching endlessly for the best decision.
- **Bounded Rationality**: limited rationality of decision maker forcing him to be satisfied with ‚Äògood enough‚Äô choice/decision not the ‚Äòbest decision‚Äô.
- Thus, the organizational decision makers (the ‚Äòadministrative Man‚Äô) ‚ÄòSatisfices‚Äô ( **satis**faction + suf**fice**) rather than maximizes like an ‚ÄòEconomic Man‚Äô.
- **Reasons for ‚Äò Bounded Rationality‚Äô:**
  - Incomplete knowledge and information of the problem, alternatives, and consequences.
  - Cognitive limitation of human brain to process information.
  - Limited time and energy.
  - Personal needs, cognitive biases- anchoring(rely too heavily, or "anchor," on one trait or piece of information when making decisions), relativity( consequences of most recent decisions affect the current decision), commitments( personal or organizational), inhibition( shyness, or many factors which stops him), and imperfectness of decision maker.
  - Structural /organizational constraints- organization norm, culture, communication gap, etc.
- Bounded rationality is often linked to Incrementalism; **help organization stabilize and maintain order and continuity** with small changes and gradual adaptation to its environment.

**Critical analysis of the Rational Decision-Making Theory:**

**The theory is criticised on following counts:**

- It created the **value-fact dichotomy** in Public Administration. The theory advocated Value Fact separation and emphasised on factual judgement in decision making.
- Value neutral science of public administration, which Simon recommended, is problematic and highly contested. Many thinkers, such as Dwight Waldo, criticised the theory for robbing the ‚Äòvalue‚Äôs out of Public Administration.
- Condemned ‚Äòprinciples‚Äô of administration, as given by the classical thinkers, such as Taylor and Weber, but couldn‚Äôt provide any alternative explanatory theory of administration.
- His ‚Äòbounded rationality‚Äô may lead to status quo, and incrementalism in organisational decision making.
  - Didn‚Äôt consider contextual or environmental constraints on decision making.
- His ‚Äòadministrative man‚Äô being ‚Äò **intendedly rational‚Äô** (decision makers intend to be rational but are limited by his/her bounded rationality at workplace) is not accepted now. Many thinkers now believe that humans are inherently irrational in their decision making.
- Simon, and his rational decision theory, are also criticised for bringing back the **politics administration dichotomy** in the Public Administration discourse. I will explain this point below under discussion.

Despite such criticism, rational decision making was, in all respect, a path breaking theory which changed the paradigm of organisational study.

**Following are some of the pluses of the theory:**

- Gave most influential theory of decision making in organization- Rational Choice Theory.
- Revealed contradictions, gaps, and unscientific nature of ‚Äòprinciples‚Äô of administration given by the classical era thinkers.
- Gave path breaking novel concepts ‚ÄòBounded Rationality‚Äô and ‚ÄòSatisficing‚Äô. ‚Ä¢ Re-defined organization as sites (network/structure) of hierarchical decision making. ‚Ä¢ Initiated the theory building enterprise on organizational decision-making process.
- Gave academic discipline of Public Administration a scientific, fact based, analytical modern attitude.
- The theory, by taking many hypotheses from economics and psychology, gave the Public Administration an inter-disciplinary approach.

**Discussion & Conclusion:**

Rational decision-making theory by Herbert Simon was a path breaking theoretical enterprise in the academic domain of public administration. It greatly influenced the academic discourse in public administration for next many decades. The essence of the theory was bringing the focus on the decision making in organisation. In fact, the theory viewed organisation as hierarchically structured decision-making centres to achieve the overall organisational goal.

The theory proposed rationality in decision making in which the administrator first scan the environment to identify the problem to which the decision would be the solution; then in the next step all the possible alternatives or means to solve that problem are identified, analysed, and evaluated. In the third and final step, the best and the least cost alternative or means is chosen and adopted as a decision or solution to the problem.

Herbert Simon also gave a novel concept of bounded rationality and satisficing behaviour of the ‚Äòadministrative man‚Äô in the organisational setting. The theory had the force of a new idea based on logical positivism, scientific orientation, and factual judgement. It took the public administration field by storm. It actually changed the paradigm of public administration. It started decisional approach to study organisational behaviour.

Despite such plusses, the theory has been criticized on many counts. Many thinkers such as Dwight Waldo, Norton E Long and Vincent Ostrom criticized Simon for separating facts and value in administration. Waldo led a movement to bring back value preferences in administrative decisions. That led to New Public Administration (NPA) after the first Minnowbrook conference in 1968.

The theory is also criticized for reviving the politics- administration dichotomy. The the theory claimed that only in the first step, that is, the intelligence step, value judgement should be brought in, and thereafter only the factual judgement should decide the search, evaluation, and choice of alternatives. This was taken as indirect way of bringing back the value-fact and politics-administration dichotomy in public administration. The theory focuses more on factual judgements leaving aside the value judgement only to top administration and political masters.

Despite such criticism there is no doubt that rational decision-making theory of Simon had a long-lasting impact on both the theory and practice of public administration. In fact, rational decision making has become a gold standard in organisational decision-making process for many decades.

**ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION**

**6.A : CBCS SYLLABUS**

- Theory of Entrepreneurship and Innovation by Peter Drucker.
- Core principles, features & characteristics.
- Pros and cons of the theory.

**6. B: KEY POINTS:**

- **Meaning of Entrepreneurship:**
  - The Entrepreneur shifts economic resources out of an area of lower productivity and yield( output/return) into an area of higher productivity and greater yield. (J.B.Say)
    - **Everyday Meaning**: Entrepreneur is one who starts his own business.
  - **Capitalist meaning**: That spirit and attitude which enable one to take risk, manage resources to run business for profit.
  - **But for Peter Drucker**, who is considered as the founder of modern management, **Entrepreneurship is creating something new,** something different; Entrepreneurs change or enhance values; *they don‚Äôt do existing thing better, they do different thing*
  - ‚ÄòNew‚Äô can be New Market, New Product, even old product with new customer centric features, New way of use of existing product, new policies, or new way of implementing existing policies. etc
  - Entrepreneurial businesses are those which are driven by Entrepreneurial spirit. They can be small or big, existing or new; they can be even non-business- school, hospital, library, and of course public administration.
  - Entrepreneurship is behavioural trait rather than personality trait. Its foundation lies in concept, theory, and practices rather than in intuition or hunch. Entrepreneurship and innovation, is not God gifted, they can be learnt and practiced.
- **Meaning of Innovation:**
  - Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs; For Peter Drucker, Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or satisfies needs of customers.
  - Thus, merely a new idea, discovery, or invention is not innovation. Only when they are converted into useful product/services, innovation happens. Thus, innovation is commercialization of new idea/invention for solving human needs/problems.
- Entrepreneurship and Innovation are must for public administration for creating public value.
- **Entrepreneurial Strategies:**

**Drucker gave the following 4 Entrepreneurial strategies :**

- **‚ÄòFustest with the Mostest‚Äô**
- Aiming at market leadership from the beginning.
- Big bang strategy: surprise the market with your product/service which has unique value- cheapest, innovative, accessible to many, etc.
  - ***Example**:* Reliance Jio- cheapest and most value added mobile phone service; Uber/Ola: new way of car hiring; Amazon- new way of shopping and selling.
- **Creative Imitation** / "Hit them where they ain‚Äôt‚Äù
  - Take the new idea/invention from anywhere to convert them into successful product/service/business model.
  - **Examples**: Sony (Japan) using the invention of transistor device to become largest producer of pocket Radio; Chinese mobile phone companies: they imitate the inventions done elsewhere to produce cheapest, but feature loaded mobile phones.
- **Entrepreneurial Judo**
  - Aim at entering a market where the established leaders cannot defend or simply do not care about that segment.
  - Turns what the market leaders consider their strengths into the very weaknesses that defeat them.
  - Entrepreneurial judo entails attacking slowly but surely, to never challenge the position of the market leader but instead, to occupy niches( specific spot in the market) that were not well defended by the market‚Äôs pioneers. Once the newcomer secures these niche territories, he should inch his way to dominate the rest (especially those occupied by the market leader), therefore catching the market leader off-guard.
  - **Examples**: Japanese became the leaders in small car segment in American and European markets: Same strategies they adopted in photo copiers, then in machine tools, in consumer electronics, and Fax machines.
- **Finding and occupying a specialized "Ecological Niche‚Äù**
  - ***Niche is specific market segment. For example, audio speakers by Bose.***
  - Toll-gate position: Essential piece of bigger product: brake pads of car; Kettering‚Äôs self-starter in the car.
  - Speciality Skills or Speciality Market: Grameen bank in Bangladesh; American Express Travelers Cheque‚Äîa specialty-market niche.
- In Public Administration, innovations can be both in policy making and policy implementations. Five types are Innovations can be found in Indian Public Administration
  - Technological, Managerial, increasing Citizens‚Äô Choice, Governance, and collaborative.
- Innovations in Indian public administration, however, are more on service delivery and process oriented and less on Citizens‚Äô Choice and Governance.

**6.C: ANSWER TEMPLATES OF PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER**

**IMPORTANT QUESTION**

**Q.1: Discuss the principles of entrepreneurship and Innovation as given by Peter Drucker**

**Answer Template: Introduction**:

Common sense meaning of Entrepreneurship is starting one‚Äôs own business. Innovation is understood, a day to day language, as new idea, invention, and discovery. But for **Peter Drucker**, who is considered as the founder of modern management, Entrepreneurship is creating something new**,** something different; Entrepreneurs change or enhance values; they don‚Äôt make existing thing better, they do different thing. Drucker also gave an altogether new meaning to Innovation. To him, innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs. Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or satisfies needs of customers. Thus, merely a new idea. discovery, or invention is not innovation. Only when they are converted into useful product/services, innovation happens. Thus, innovation is commercialization of new idea/invention.

Entrepreneurship and Innovation are must for public administration for creating public value which is the ultimate goal or aim of Public Administration. By Entrepreneurship and Innovation, public managers/administrators can create or enhance public value through their decisions and actions. For example, by implementing new and innovative garbage collection and disposal system, a public officer in Municipality can bring cleanliness in the township. This way, he/she can create public value.

- Thus, Peter Drucker gave entirely new meaning and dimensions to the Entrepreneurship and Innovation in management and administration. His ideas of Entrepreneurship and Innovation were equally valid for Public Administration.

In the next section of the answer I will try to explain the 4 Entrepreneurial strategies given by Peter Drucker. I will also try to explain his idea of innovation and how those can be used in Public Administration for creating public value.

- **Drucker gave the following 4 Entrepreneurial strategies:** ‚Ä¢

**‚ÄòFustest with the Mostest‚Äô**

- Taken from military strategies during war*,* aiming at market leadership from the beginning.
- Big bang strategy: surprise the market and your competitors with your product/service which has unique value- cheapest, innovative, accessible to many, etc.
- **Example*:* Reliance Jio**- cheapest and most value added mobile phone service; Uber**/**Ola: new way of car hiring; Amazon- new way of shopping and selling.
- **Creative Imitation** / "Hit them where they ain‚Äôt‚Äù
  - Take the new idea/invention from anywhere to convert them into successful product/service/business model.


- Examples: Sony (Japan) using the invention of transistor device to become largest producer of pocket Radio; Chinese mobile phone companies: they imitate the inventions done elsewhere to produce cheapest but feature loaded mobile phones.
- **Entrepreneurial Judo**
  - Aim at entering a market where the established leaders cannot defend or simply do not care about that segment.
  - Turns what the market leaders consider their strengths into the very weaknesses that defeat them.
  - Entrepreneurial judo entails( requires) attacking slowly but surely, to never challenge the position of the market leader but instead, to occupy niches ( market spots) that were not well defended by the market‚Äôs pioneers. Once the newcomer secures these niche territories, he should inch his way to dominate the rest (especially those occupied by the market leader), therefore catching the market leader off-guard.
  - **Examples**: Japanese became the leaders in small car segment in American and European markets: Same strategies they adopted in photo copiers, then in machine tools, in consumer electronics, and Fax machines.
- **Finding and occupying a specialized "Ecological Niche‚Äù**
  - Niche is specific market segment. For example: Grameen Bank of Bangladesh which specialized in micro financing.
  - Toll-gate position: Essential piece of bigger product: brake pads of car ; Kettering‚Äôs self-starter in the car.
  - Speciality Skills or Speciality Market: Bose audio & Music systems; American Express Travelers Cheque‚Äîa specialty-market niche.

**Entrepreneurship in Public Administration;**

- Behavioural trait of public managers/administrators when they innovate in their area of work to create public value. Public administrators having Entrepreneurial spirit are able to look beyond rules/regulation to realize the potential in their role/position to think and do something new.
- Innovation in Public Administration requires Public manager being proactive and willing to think beyond their defined work responsibilities. Entrepreneurial Public Administrator is willing to take risk by implementing new ideas to make life better of the citizen.
  - **Examples**: Moore, in his book ‚Äò*creating public value‚Äô,* gives an example of entrepreneurial public manager- one city librarian who floated, get accepted, and implemented the idea of innovative library services for latchkey children (those who are left in the cr√®che by their working parents).
  - **E. Sreedharan** : The Metro man of India- his innovation changed the face of public transport in metro cities of India.
  - **Verghese Kurien:** Father of White (Milk) Revolution in India and brain behind AMUL.
- **Nandan Nilakeni:** Who as head of Aadhar project implemented largest unique ID project of the world.

**Innovation: The Engine of Entrepreneurship:**

- For Peter Drucker, Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which satisfies needs of customers or solves problems of people.
  - Thus, Innovation is a new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device, service or method, way of doing things- anything which make life easier and add value.
    - Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, who must innovate to succeed.

Entrepreneurs should know how to apply innovations to create value for customers.

- Innovation can be presented as a discipline, capable of being learned, and capable of being practiced.
- Entrepreneurs need to search purposefully for the sources of innovation, the changes and their symptoms that indicate opportunities for successful innovation.

**Role of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Public Administration**

- Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Public Administration can be a core driver to ensure that it becomes efficient, effective, more citizen centric, and create more public value.
- In the context of public administration, Innovation implies creation and adoption of new idea and practices to help make new and innovative public policy, plan, program, scheme, and their implementation in new and innovative ways to create public value. Thus, innovation can be applied both in policy making and policy implementation.
- Under the New Public Management Paradigm, citizens are treated as customers and Public manager should have Entrepreneurial spirit to serve ‚Äòthe customer‚Äô.

**Conclusion**:

Peter Drucker, one of greatest thinkers of modern management and founder of modern business management studies, gave the principles of Entrepreneurship and Innovation which are applicable to both private management, business enterprises and Public Administration. According to Drucker, entrepreneurs create something new**,** something different; they change or enhance values; they don‚Äôt do existing thing better, they do different thing. Entrepreneurial public administrators have behavioral trait of innovation in their area of work to create public value. They think beyond their defined role/responsibilities to give new meaning and dimension to their jobs. In sum, entrepreneurial spirit is to enhance value by using innovation as tool.

Thus, innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs; For Peter Drucker, Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a goods or services that creates value or which satisfies needs of customers. It may be noted that mere a new idea or invention is not innovation. Only when those ideas/inventions are converted into useful product/services, innovation happen. Entrepreneurship and Innovation are must for public administration to create public value.

Drucker gave four (4) Entrepreneurial Strategies, names of which used unique and unusual words and rhymes : *1.Fustest with the Mostest, 2.Creative Imitation, 3.Entrepreneurial Judo,* *and 4.Finding and occupying a specialized "ecological niche‚Äú.* Most of these are applicable to business enterprises. However, they may also be used in Public Administration.

In Public Administration innovations can be both in policy making and policy implementations. Five types are Innovations can be found in Indian Public Administration ‚Äì Technological, Managerial, increasing Citizens‚Äô Choice, Governance, and collaborative. Innovations in Indian public administration, however, are more on service delivery and process oriented and less on Citizens‚Äô Choice and Governance.

**Q.2: Explain in brief Management By Objective (MBO) as given by Peter Drucker.**

**Similar Question:**

**Q.** Critically examine Peter Drucker Theory of Management by Objectives(MBO).

*(Note: the syllabus does not mention MBO, but question have been asked on this theme. Hence answer on MBO is included.)*

**Answer Template: Introduction**:

Management by objectives (MBO) as a management strategy was first outlined by Peter Drucker, one of greatest thinkers of modern management and founder of modern business management studies, in his 1954 book, ‚Äò*The Practice of Management*.‚Äô

MBO is a strategic management model that aims to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and performance of an organization in which each employee set his/her own targets/objectives in consultation with management. Targets of each employees are fixed such as to meet the overall organizational goal/objectives, which emanate( originate) from vision/mission of the organization. Thus, in MBO, each and every employee‚Äôs efforts are aligned towards meeting the organizational goal/objective and through them the vision/mission of the organization.

According to the theory, having a say in goal setting and action plans to achieve them encourages participation and commitment among employees. It also aligns activities across the organization towards the overall organizational objectives. It also raises employee‚Äôs motivation and self-esteem. They feel empowered and important. This make the job more meaningful to the employees.

Despite such benefits, the MBO is criticized for giving too much importance to achieving targets by any means. Also, targets are related mostly to economic and financial aspects, leaving other aspects of the organizational goal. Employees may adopt unethical means and short cuts to achieve targets. This may harm the organization in long run. It undermines other important aspects such as organizational culture, work ethics, customer services, training & development, etc.

In the next section of the answer I will try to explain in brief the principles of the MBO, how in practice it is implemented, and its pros and cons.

**Core Principles of MBO:**

- Each employee in the organization should be aware of the overall organizational goal/objectives.
- They should also be able to link their own job and its outcome to the overall organizational goal.
- Target/goal of each employee are laid out in consultation with the employees and are meant to be challenging but achievable.
- MBO is aligning goals and objectives dispersed throughout the organization at different job points towards the overall goal/objective of the organization.
- Employees receive daily feedback on progress of their outputs/targets for continuous improvement. The focus is on rewards rather than punishment.
- Personal growth and development are emphasized, rather than focusing on negativities for failing to reach the targets.
- Success of MBO is dependent on the support from top management, clearly outlined objectives which are specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic, time-bound, supportive organizational culture, and trained managers who can implement it.

**5 Steps of MBO:**

1. **Setting organizational Goal/objective**: from the firm‚Äôs mission and vision, goal/objectives, both short and medium term, are derived, reviewed, and finalized for a given time period, say one year.
1. **Conveying the organizational objectives to employees**: organization's objectives are shared with employees, from the top to the bottom. Aim is to make the employee understand and identify their role in relation to the organizational goal. Drucker used the acronym SMART (specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic, time-bound) to express the features of the goals/objectives.
1. **Setting individual‚Äôs goal/objectives by participation and deliberations**: employees should be encouraged to help set their own goals/targetsto achieve the larger organizational objectives. This gives employees greater motivation since they have greater empowerment over setting targets for them and also adopting suitable means to achieve them.
1. **Monitoring the progress of goal/target achievement**: In step two, a key component of the objectives was that they are measurable, so that employees and managers may determine how well are they met in course of time. Output of each employee is monitored continuously and compared to targets fixed for them.
1. **Evaluate and reward employee progress**. This step includes honest feedback on what was achieved and not achieved for each employee, and reasons for success and failures in meeting targets.

**Pros and Cons of Management by Objectives (MBO)**

**The Plusses or benefits are:**

- Aligning each employee‚Äôs efforts towards meeting organisational goal. Thus, giving unity of direction to the organisation.
- Sense of empowerment and importance in employees, for they have the say in fixing their own target as well deciding upon the ways & means to achieve them.
- Feedback and reward on meeting goal raise employee‚Äôs motivation and give them a sense of purpose.
- Help increase the ‚Äòwe‚Äô feeling, as all employee feel part of the same endeavour- to meet organisational goal.
- Employees are able to better relate to and value their jobs. This lessen alienation from the job, a typical problem in capitalist mode of production.
- leads to increased communication between management and employees.
- Each employee is linked directly to vision/mission of the organisation. It makes the organisation much more cohesive, purposeful, and effective.

**The Minuses or the disadvantages are:**

- As MBO is focused on goals and targets, it often ignores other aspects of a organisation, such as organisational culture, values, norms of conduct, a healthy work ethos, and areas for involvement and contribution.
  - MBO puts increased strain on employees to meet the goals in a specified time frame.
- If management solely relies on MBO for all management responsibilities, it can be problematic for areas that don't fit under MBO.
- Vision and mission of organisation may be vague. Getting goals/objective from them may not be perfect.
- It leaves means to achieve the targets/goal to employee‚Äôs discretion. This may lead to employees trying to achieve the targets by unethical or harmful means. In long run this may harm the organisation.
- The goal/objectives may not be balanced. For example, goals may be heavily tilted towards financial/economic aspects. This may undermine other performance areas such as business processes, customer services, and training & development, etc.

**Conclusion:**

Management by objective or MBO was an innovative strategic management tool first propounded by Peter Drucker, one of the greatest thinkers of management in modern times. The core principle of MBO is to align each and every employee‚Äôs jobs towards achieving the overall organisational goal and objectives. In turn, the organisational goal and objectives are derived from the Vision and Mission of the organisation. Thus, through MBO each employee feel that he/she is contributing towards attaining the vision and mission of the organisation. This gives unity of purpose and direction to the organisation.

The target/goal of each employee is fixed in consultation with the employee concerned. The employee has a definite say in fixing his/her target. Employees are also given the liberty to adopt suitable ways and means to achieve the target fixed for them. Both, having their say in the targets/goals fixed for them, and having the liberty to adopt suitable means to achieve those targets give a sense of empowerment and commitment to the employee. They develop a sense of purpose as they clearly see their job linked to achievement of the overall organisational goal.

Another important component of MBO is periodic assessment of the progress of targets, feedback, and corrective actions. The focus is more on reward and development of the employees then on punishment.

Despite such benefits of increasing efficiency, effectiveness, and performance of the organisation, MBO is criticized for giving too much importance to achieving targets by hook or by crook. It undermines other important aspects of the organisation which are not linked directly to achieving the production or financial targets. Most of the time the targets are usually related to production and profits which undermine other organisational activities such as internal business process, customer services, and training & development, etc.

Despite this, Management by Objective was a very important management strategic tool to align the diverse job points of the organisation towards the overall organisational goal, employees empowerment, engagement, and developing a sense of purpose and commitment in the employees. In recent years there have been many improvements in the original concept of MBO to make it more balanced by including other important organisational aspects and making it more robust and streamlined.

**THEME 7 : CONTEMPORARY THEORIES**

**ECOLOGICAL APPROACH**

**7.A : CBCS SYLLABUS**

- Ecological Approach by Fred Riggs
- Its importance to understand Public Administration in developing nations. ‚Ä¢ Core propositions/principles, pros and cons of the theory.

**7. B: KEY POINTS:**

- Ecological approach attempts to understand and analyze the inter-relationship and interaction between public organization and its socio-cultural environment.
- Fred Riggs used this approach along with systemic and structural functional approach to formulate innovative and interesting models to explain public administration in 3rd world developing countries.
- On the basis of functional overlap between societal structure/institutions, Riggs categorised societies into 3 types- Fused, Prismatic, and Diffracted or refracted.
- **Fused Societies:** Primitive-tribal/rural/agrarian societies in which Single structure( organisation/institution) does all functions- socio-political-religious. For example, the tribal chief is leader of the community, doing the functions of political and religious head, too.
- **Diffracted Societies**: Developed societies in western countries. Separate structure for each function, no functional overlapping. Such societies are characterised by

merit/achievement, rule based, Individualism, universalism (rules applied uniformly to all cases), realism (no contradiction between formal rules and traditional/customary practices), autonomy of sectors/structures, etc.

- **Prismatic Society**: Societies in post-colonial developing countries are represented as transitional or prismatic society. They are characterized by **Formalism** (Gap between Rules/Regulation and their actual implementation), **Heterogeneity** (Great diversity, contradictions, and differences in socio-economic conditions, practices, world views, infrastructure, facilities, etc.), and **Functional overlapping**( Mixing and intermingling of political, economic, administrative, religious, moral/ethical sectors- autonomy of different sectors and structures are diluted.)
- Administrative sub system in prismatic society is represented by ‚Äò**Sala‚Äô model** characterized by ritualistic proceduralism, high bureaucratic discretion, impact of non administrative factors, selectivism, nepotism, intra-bureaucratic politics, and corruption.
- Economic sub-system of the prismatic society is represented by the ‚Äò**Bazar-canteen‚Äô model**. Typical market principles, as in capitalist markets, does not apply here. The market treats people based on their social status and position in social hierarchy.
- Its pluses: Understanding public organization in its socio-cultural context, comparative public administration, focus on 3rd world, and innovative models to understand ecological aspect of Public Administration.
- Its Minuses: Complex and confusing terminologies, Ethnocentrism, Eurocentrism, Orientalism, deductive and qualitative, status quoist, and negative orientation towards prismatic society.

**7.C: ANSWER TEMPLATES OF PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION**

**Q.1 : Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach has made substantial contribution to the understanding of Public Administration. Elaborate.**

**Similar Questions:**

1\.Critically evaluate the contribution of Fred Rigg‚Äôs ecological model to public administration. 2. Critically Analyze Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach for developing society.

**Answer Template:**

**Introduction:**

Fred Rigg‚Äôs ecological model to public administration was an attempt to understand the inter-relation, interdependence, and mutual impact between public organization and its socio-cultural environment. Ecological approach to organizational studies believes that just like plant or organism can survive only if adapted to its environment, organizations continually adjust and adapt to their external environment. The superstructure of the society- its socio-political and legal system, ideology & worldview, Socio-cultural and religious norms, traditions, and practices, communal make up of society, rural-urban divide, etc- forms the environment of the organization. Organizations continuously interact and get adapted (adjusted) to its environment. This interaction affects the organizational structure, function, and behaviour.

Ecological approach to organization was initiated by J.M. Caus, Robert A. Dahl , Robert A. Merton but taken to its new heights by Fred W. Riggs, who was Professor Emeritus at Political Science Department of University of Hawaii. Riggs gave empirical, scientific, comparative, and 3rd world orientation to ecological approach to understand public administration in developing countries. He used system and structural functional approach, combined them with his own innovative concepts and terminologies, mostly taken from science, to formulate his innovative ecological models of Public Administration. Since then, Inter-relation of organization and its environment has become an accepted fact of organizational studies.

Rigg‚Äôs focus had been the post-colonial 3rd world developing countries. Doing empirical studies of socio-cultural and administrative practices of Philippines, Thailand, and India, Riggs developed interesting and novel models- Fused, Prismatic, Diffracted societies, Bazar-Canteen, and Sala model- to help understand the features and dynamics of public administration in developing countries.

In the next section of the answer I will try to explain in the brief of the ecological model to public administration as developed by Riggs and how it has made substantial contribution to the understanding of Public Administration in developing countries. Thereafter, I will list out some the pluses and minuses of Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach as part of its critical analysis.

**Rigg‚Äôs ecological ecological model to public administration: Core propositions (hypothesis):**

**3 types of Society: Fused, Prismatic, and Diffracted:**

On the basis of system and structural functional analysis, Riggs categorised societies into the following 3 types:

1. **Fused Societies:** Primitive-tribal/rural/agrarian societies in which Single structure (organisation/institution) does all the functions- socio-political-religious. For example, the tribal chief is leader of the community, doing the functions of political and religious head, too. Such societies are characterised by ascriptive ( by birth) roles/entitlements , kinship based social ties, particularistic ( case by case treatment), realism ( no contradiction between formal rules and traditional/customary practices), and socio-political religious integration.
1. **Prismatic Societies:** Transitional developing societies such as 3rd world developing countries. Lots of functional Overlapping among structures. Same functions are done by multiple structures and same structure may perform multiple functions**.** Such societies are characterised by Formalism (contradiction between formal rules and traditional/customary norms and practices), Overlapping, Heterogeneity ( Great diversity, contradictions, and differences in socio-economic conditions, practices, world views, infrastructure, facilities, etc.), and Selectivism ( rules applied selectively on case to case basis).

   3\.**Diffracted Societies**: Developed societies in western countries. Separate structure for each function, no functional overlapping. Such societies are characterised by Merit/achievement, rule based, Individualism, universalism (rules applied uniformly to all cases), realism (no contradiction between formal rules and traditional/customary practices), autonomy of sectors/structures, etc.

**Unique features of Public Administration in the Prismatic Societies:**

Following are some of the peculiar features of Public Administration in developing countries having features of Prismatic society:

**Formalism:**

- **Formalism**: Gap between Rules/Regulation and their actual implementation.
  - Rules/regulations and institutions imported and imposed from western influence do not have roots in socio-cultural environment, well established social norms, traditions, and practices.
  - Constitutional Formalism: gap between constitutional provisions and actual political or governance practice.
- **Reasons** for high level of Formalism in Prismatic Society:
  - Social norms, traditions, culture, and practices are out of tune with modern (western) Rules/Regulations.
  - Changes are ‚Äòexo-genetic‚Äô ‚Äì brought from outside, not endo-genetic ‚Äì from inside. ‚Ä¢ Masses are illiterate, custom bound, not aware of modern rules/regulations.
- **Effects of Formalism on public administration**
  - Street level bureaucracy- each public official interprets rules as per his own discretion and convenience.
    - More discretionary power to Bureaucracy, which breeds corruption.
  - Ritualization of procedures- insistence of complex and unnecessary procedures- ‚ÄòRed Tapeism‚Äô
- **Examples**:
  - Rampant traffic violation in smaller Indian towns.
  - Shops and business establishments in residential area.
  - Constitutional guarantee on fundamental right and its gross violation in practices. ‚Ä¢

Favouritism, nepotism, mal-practices in appointments in public offices. **Heterogeneity:**

- Great diversity, contradictions, and differences in socio-economic conditions, practices, world views, infrastructure, facilities, public administration.
  - co-existence of contrasting systems pulling the society in different directions.
- Islands of modern, formal structures, and facilities in ocean of chaos, traditional structures and practices.
- **Example**:
  - Modern, swanky MNC offices and city life vs mud houses, poor, and illiterate rural life- barely few km apart.
  - BMW and Bullock cart running parallel on same road.
  - Parliament making laws based on constitution vs Khap panchayats( caste panchayat) dispensing justice on traditional laws.
- **Reasons**: Transitional society, exo-genetic changes, Poly-communalism, regional, sectoral, sectional disparity in development.
- **Impact on public administration**: Difficult to formulate policies, diffused goals, tough adjustments in structure and practices, paradoxes and conflicts.

**Overlapping:**

- Mixing and intermingling of political, economic, administrative, religious, moral/ethical sectors- autonomy of different sectors and structures are diluted.
- Co-existence of formally differentiated structures of a diffracted society co-exist with undifferentiated structures of a fused type.
- Thus, non-administrative factors- economic, political, religious- may affect public administration.
- Same functions by multiple structures and same structure doing multiple functions. ‚Ä¢ **Example**:
  - Caste/sect-based associations doing educational, philanthropic, economic, and political functions
    - Non-economic factors affecting market- Bazar-Canteen Model.
  - Leaders of religious sects directing their members to support particular political party
    - Familial and social relations affecting appointments in public offices.
  - **Reasons**: Transitional society, Incomplete refraction- from fused to refracted society.
- **Impact on public administration**: Religious, political, familial, caste/social motives may distort administrative decisions, Ideal bureaucratic model of Weber highly unlikely, very difficult to adopt scientific management practices.

**SALA model of Public Administration in developing countries:**

On the basis of the concepts of - Formalism, Heterogeneity, and overlapping- explained above, Riggs gave a model of Public Administration in prismatic societies, which he named the ‚ÄòSALA‚Äô model. Following are some of the key features of the Sala model:

- Reflect the Formalism, Heterogeneity, and functional overlapping in Prismatic society. ‚Ä¢ Features of Sala Administration:
  - Rationality and efficiency co-exist with decisions based on non-administrative considerations.
  - Non-administrative considerations ‚Äì Kinship and other social obligations, economic benefits, Clects( mix of club and sect like features), political pressure, etc.
  - Attainment( like passing one exam to get lifelong benefit) rather than achievements( in relevant domain) is basis for entitlements/positions.
    - Nepotism in appointments, corruption, intra-bureaucratic Politics.
  - Public organization start behaving as Clects- patronage, personal loyalty, empire building, turf protection.
  - Selectivitism in recruitment and benefit allocation: Policy formulation and implementation for benefit of particular section/community/region and exclude some sections/community.
  - Political role of bureaucrats in policy making. Public Administration loses non

partisan, and a political attitude. They are also politicized.

- Bureaucracy getting more powerful than the formal political leadership.
- **Examples**: Indian Bureaucracy in 60s-70s, Bureaucracy in Thailand, Philippines, and in many other afro-Asian developing nations

**Critical Analysis of Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach to Public Administration and its contribution in understanding the Public Administration in developing countries:**

Following are the Plusses of Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach:

- First time inter-relation between the environment and the public organization was explored in such greater detail.
  - **Genuine attempt to understand public administration in developing nations:**
    - First time such detailed comparative study of Public Administration in developing nations was done by any modern political thinker.
    - It revealed remarkably interesting features of the way Public Administration is actually practiced in developing countries.
    - It linked the unique features of public organizations in developing countries to their socio-cultural environment which he called the prismatic societies.
    - It was an evolutionary approach to understand how societies evolve from fused to refracted status. Societies in developing countries are in between the fused and refracted one. This gives unique and interesting characteristics to prismatic societies. Those are reflected in the unique model of Public Administration in developing countries, which Riggs called ‚ÄòThe SALA Model‚Äô.
    - Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach gave deeper insight on the way Public Administration are carried out in developing countries. It also gave plausible reasons for such state of affairs.
- Finest example of Comparative study in public administration.
- It was based upon Empirical studies in multiple developing countries such as Philippines, Thailand, and India.
- Help understand nature, characteristics, and actions of public organizations, especially in developing nations. It also explained the factors and reasons behind such features/characteristics.

**But Rigg‚Äôs ecological approach is criticized on following**

**counts:** ‚Ä¢ Complex, confusing, hard to understand.

- Linguistic complexity: Terminologies/words from science(fused, prismatic, refractive, etc), coined new words- Sala, Clect, Bazar Canteen, etc.
- Ethnocentrism- viewed Public Administration of developing world from the perspective of western culture
- Eurocentrism and Orientalism: Negative characterisation of 3rd world developing country‚Äôs society as Prismatic society.

- Equilibrium and stability approach- indifferent to social change.
- Not sufficiently quantitative- qualitative approach.
- Deductive and theoretical- not sufficiently empirical.

**Conclusion:**

Fred riggs was the Pioneer in ecological approach to public administration. He also adopted genuinely comparative method to compare public administration in in different societies and cultures. Hence, he was also pioneer in comparative public administration. His ecological approach to public administration was a very novel idea. In his theory, he introduced many new terminologies, concepts, hypothesis and ideas.

Taking concepts from physics, he categorised human societies as Fused, Prismatic and diffracted/refracted. This was done on the basis of structural-functional approach, that is weather structure/institution does one and only one job or there is functional overlapping. Through his ecological approach, he found out very interesting characteristic of public administration in Prismatic societies, those societies which are found in in post-colonial states in the 3rd world developing nations.

In such societies Riggs found Formalism, Heterogeneity, Overlapping in public administration. Formalism is contradictions between written rules and regulation and actual societal norms, traditions, and practices. Heterogeneity is great diversity in form, feature, structure, and functioning of public administration from place to place and from time to time. Functional overlapping denotes that structure and institutions are not assigned any specific function. Single structure may perform many functions, whereas same function may be done by many structures. He also gave the ‚ÄòSala‚Äô model of public administration in Prismatic society based on the characteristic of public administration in Prismatic society as explained above.

Essence of Riggs‚Äô ecological theory was that it established the crucial impacts larger socio cultural environment have on the Public Administration. His theory was a path breaking endeavour to understand public administration in developing nations.

Despite this, the theory is criticized for being ethnocentric, suffering from eurocentrism and orientalism, having deductive, analytical not sufficiently quantitative and empirical, and portraying ( showing) developing countries of 3rd world in negative way**.**

**THEME 8: PUBLIC POLICY**

**8 A: CBCS SYLLABUS**

- Concept, relevance, and approaches of public policy
- Formulation, implementation, and evaluation of public policy

**8.B: KEY POINTS**

- Public **policies** are the **collective decisions** to solve common societal problems. Thus, it is nothing but decisions in public domain.

- It can be defined as a relatively **stable**, **definite** course of action **decided** by the ‚Äò**public authorities**‚Äô in dealing with a **problem** or matter of public concern.
- Public policies are the output or outcome, and hence most important part, of the political processes.
- It is through the public policy that political values and ideologies are realised. Hence, political actors and political parties try to grab political power to be able to make public policies in line with their value preferences.
- Thus, policy making involves value preferences. This gave the politics-administration dichotomy which suggested that policy making should in the domain of politics, whereas the public administration should be value free and limited to the implementation of the policies in non-partisan manner.
- Policy making are generally done by the executive arm of the state, that is the government.
- However, some policies are also made in legislative and judicial domain.
- Main actors in policy making processes are policy experts or the policy community, the political leadership, the top-level executive or bureaucracy, and the media, particularly mass and social media.
- **Policy making process** can be broken into **six stages**; these are problem identification, agenda setting, searching for the alternatives or solutions, policy formulation, policy implementation, and evaluation & feedback.
- Problems are societal conditions requiring solution. By the agenda setting process, the problem come up on the agenda table of Govt. for decisions. Some focussing event, such as mass movement, or some major catastrophe may bring the problem quickly on the agenda of the policy maker. Alternatives are the means or solutions to the problem. Policy decisions are nothing but choosing one out of many alternatives as solution to the problem.
- However, in real life policy processes do not follow such neat and clean sequential stages. Most of them are outcome of random, non-linear, non-sequential, and chaotic process. Chance and luck factor play important role in policy processes.
- Public policy is the lifeline of Public Administration. In all the stages of policy process Public Administration plays very important role. Policy implementation has been the exclusive domain of Public Administration. It plays crucial role in evaluation and mid course correction of policies. Of late, it has been also playing crucial role in policy formulation, which previously was assumed to be exclusively in the domain of politics. Senior public administrators/bureaucrat help the political leadership in all stages of policy process.
- Role of Public Administration is crucial in identification of problems, agenda setting (coming up of the problem high on the decisional agenda of Govt), and searching for best alternatives/solutions to the problem. Even in adoption of the policy, either in form of laws/act or administrative notifications, the role of Public Administration is very important. Making rules & regulation (called subordinate legislation), and operational guidelines for policy implementation is the exclusive domain of Public Administration.

**8.C: ANSWER TEMPLATES OF PAST YEAR‚ÄôS AND OTHER**

**IMPORTANT QUESTION**

**Q.1: Discuss the concept and process of public policy making. Similar question:**

1. What do you mean by public policy? How are they important for political system? How and by

whom public policies are made?

2. Discuss the concept and process of public policy in democratic set up. Who are the main actors in policy process?

   **Introduction:**

Public policies are essentially the collective decisions to solve common societal problems. It can be defined as a relatively stable, definite course of action decided by the ‚Äòpublic authorities‚Äô in dealing with a problem or matter of public concern. Public authorities who take policy decisions are generally the political leadership of the executive arm of the state, that is, the Govt. Hence, public policy is also whatever govt. chooses to do or not to do about a problem that comes before it for consideration and possible action. It can also be understood as a projected program consisting of desired objectives and means to achieve them. Finally, Public policy is the output of political system. Through policies, intended societal goals are achieved. Power in politics denote capacity to enforce policy of one‚Äôs choice. Thus, political parties aim to acquire power to formulate public policies in line with their political ideologies and value preferences.

From the above introduction it is obvious that Public policy is **collective decision-making** process to **solve public problems**.

All the public policies originate from the supreme law of a nation which is the constitution. From the constitution laws, passed by the Legislature, are enacted. The public policies are either themselves based on some acts/ laws or are administrative decisions consistent with the existing Acts/laws. From the public policy different plans, programs, schemes and missions comes out as part of the implementation of the public policy. Hence, we can place public policy in a hierarchical order starting from constitution, followed by laws/acts, then public policy, and thereafter the plan, program, schemes, and missions.

Since public policies are collective decisions to solve societal problems they are decided or formulated by the political leadership of a nation. It may be noted that policy formulation involves value judgement. What societal conditions can be identified as problems? which problems will come up high on the government‚Äôs agenda for solution? which of the possible alternatives or means shall be chosen as the solution to the identified problems? Answers to all these vital questions are subject to the value preferences of the decision makers. In democracy

the representatives of people elected through direct voting are given the key responsibilities of formulating the public policy. In Parliamentary form of Government, it is the executive arm of the state, that is the government, which is supposed to make public policy. However, some policies are also made in Legislative and Judicial domains. It may also be noted that on the issue of who should make public policy, the politics-administration dichotomy was created. Starting with Woodrow Wilson, many thinkers believed that policy making is the domain of politics, for it involves political values. Whereas the policy implementation should be done by


the public administration in non-partisan a-political manner. In later years, this dichotomy was diluted. Now a days, Public Administration plays an important role in policy making.

Policy making include 4 sequential stages; first, identification of common problems of the society which require solution; second, agenda setting, that is the identified problem comes high on government‚Äôs agenda for decision; third, search for the suitable alternatives/ means as solution to the identified problem and fourth, attaching the chosen alternative as the solution to the identified problem. The final step is the decision or the choice of alternative which is called the policy. Therefore, the policies are nothing but the decisions taken in a collective manner to solve common societal problems. Policy process includes all stages of policy making and two additional stages- Policy implementation and policy evaluation & feedback. Thus, all together policy process has 6 stages.

In the next section of the answer I will try to explain features and processes of the public policy. I will also try to highlight the importance of public policy in any political system, and main actors who are involved in policy processes.

**Features of Public Policy:**

- Policy is solution to issue or problem (policy demands) that are brought on agenda of govt. and requires its attention and decision.
- Thus, essentially policy is collective decision to solve public problem.
- Policy may be in form of law/act, rules/regulation, administrative orders, plan, program, schemes, guidelines, codes or combinations of these.
  - **Examples**: Energy Conservation Act 2001(Act); New Education Policy 2020( administrative notification), Ayushman Bharat Mission, Mid-Day Meal( program), etc.
- Policy is what Govt actually does, not just what it intends to do. Thus, it is the decision to follow definite course of action to solve a common problem.
- Policy is sustained course of actions based on a decision taken over time, not discrete (disconnected) decisions and actions thereon.
- Policy is the output or outcome of the political process.
- Policy output vs outcome:
  - Output: measurable physical results of policy
  - Outcome: policy‚Äôs consequences on target group/society- improvement in social conditions

**Who Make Public Policy?**

As stated above, policy is the domain of executive organ of the state, that is the Govt. But some policies are also made in in Legislative and Judicial domains. Following are the examples of Policies made in all the three domains:

- Legislative policy: Energy Conservation Act 2001; Reservation quota for disadvantaged groups, Aadhar Act, etc
- Executive Policies: New Telecom Policy (NTP) , MNAREGA, Ayushman Bharat Mission, Kisan Samman, Mid-Day Meal, DBT, etc.
- Policies originating from Judiciary: ‚ÄòCreamy layer‚Äô policy in reservation, Policy of

Judges appointment, Auction policy of natural resources such as spectrum and coal bloc.

**Main Actors in Policy making Process :**

- **Policy experts : the policy community**
  - Niti Aayog
  - Domain experts
  - Policy Institutes and organisations
  - Professional associations and interest groups
  - Mass leader, civil society
- **Political Leadership**
  - They are one who take policy decisions. They make policies.
  - PM, CM, and central/state ministers
  - Top Party leaders
- **Executives/ Bureaucracy**
  - Top level executives in central/state Govt. help political leadership in policy making
  - Prime minister‚Äôs office( PMO): of late, the most important actor in Indian context. ‚Ä¢

**Media: Mass and Social media**

- plays important role in problem identification and bring that problem high in the decision-making agenda of the Govt.

**Policy making Processes: How Policies are made?**

Following are the sequential steps/stages of the policy process:

1. **Problem Identification**: Problems are conditions requiring solution. For example,

farmer‚Äôs suicide is a condition which indicate towards many problems in farm sector. One of the problems may be huge debt (farm loan).

2. **Agenda setting**: The problem is brought high on the decision table of Govt. Media and opinion leaders play important role in agenda setting. Some focusing event, such as mass farmer‚Äôs movement, may bring the problem on top of the Govt‚Äôs agenda.
2. **Searching for alternatives or solutions**: Here role of policy community and experts become important. All the available alternatives are evaluated to find the best one.
2. **Policy formulations**: The best or chosen alternative is presented in form of the policy as solution to the problem. This is declaration of the policy decision in form of either acts, plan, program, scheme, mission.
2. **Policy implementation**: This is the exclusive domain of Public Administration. Policies are implemented in the form of plan, program, scheme, mission.
2. **Evaluation & Feedback**: The Policies are fine-tuned, changed, or dropped on the basis of evaluation and feedback.

It may be noted that in real life, Policy processes seldom follow the above-mentioned sequential stages. They may be random, non-linear, non-sequential, chaotic, and unexpected. Many policies

are outcome of some chance or luck factor.

**Conclusion:**

In essence, public policy is collective decision making to solve common societal problems. Thus, it is nothing but decisions in public domain. They are the output or outcome, and hence most important part, of the political processes. It is through the public policy that political values and ideologies are realised. Hence, political actors and political parties try to grab political power to be able to make public policies in line with their ideologies. Hence, it is obvious that policy making involves value preferences. This gave the politics

administration dichotomy which suggested that policy making should in the domain of politics, whereas the public administration should be value free and limited to the implementation of the policies in non-partisan manner.

Policy making are generally done by the executive arm of the state, that is the government. However, some policies are also made in legislative and judicial domain. Main actors in policy making processes are policy experts or the policy community, the political leadership, the top-level executive or bureaucracy, and the media particularly mass and social media.

Policy processes can be broken into six stages; these are problem identification, agenda setting, searching for the alternatives or solutions, policy formulation, policy implementation, and evaluation & feedback. First 4 stages are part of policy making and remaining 2 policy implementation and evaluation. However, in real life policy processes do not follow such neat and clean sequential stages. Most of them are outcome of random, non-linear, non-sequential, and chaotic process. Chance and luck factor play important role in policy processes.

**Q.2: Discuss the various approaches to public policies.**

**Similar question:**

1\. Explain in brief different models of public policy.

**Answer Template: Introduction:**

A model is a simplified representation of some aspect of real world. For example, model of an upcoming market complex. Approaches are theoretical models or conceptual construct of the real-world phenomena. Thus, approaches to public policy are conceptual models to the real-life policy processes. They help understand and analyze policymaking process and its related components. Different Approaches to public policy are like lenses, frame of reference, or viewing something from a specific perspective.

Most of the approaches are guided by specific ideologies. Hence, they may be understood as ideological lenses to view actual policy process. For example, the elite approach wears the left or Marxist lens, from which the policy process looks like arena of class dominance. In this approach, the Elites prevail upon the masses by having last say in policy making. The policies carry the value preferences of the elites. Masses are mere receivers of those policies. On the other hand, if one sees policy making from group or pluralist approach, the same policy process looks different. Now policy process denotes fair competition among interest groups to have policy favouring their interests and preferences.

Theoretical approaches to public policy help provide answers to the questions How public policy are made? Who and which factors decide the policy? Who are the main actors in policy process? How policy is changed? etc. Thus, they help study policy processes and understand better the different aspects of the actual policy making process. They help clarify and organize our thought process about politics and public policy, and help explain and analyze policymaking in different political systems and contexts.

Political system, Group or pluralist, Elite theory, Rational choice, Institutionalism, Incrementalism are some of the most popular models or approaches to public policy.

Following are the brief explanation of these approaches, their features, and pros and cons:

**Political System Theory:**

- **Political system**: Self-sustaining social entity consisting of institutions, political activities and processes which interact among themselves and provides arena for politics.
- Inputs to the system:
  - Demands : claims for actions that people make to satisfy their interests and values ‚Ä¢ Support: political obligation to the ruler/Govt‚Äì Consent, obey law, pay taxes
